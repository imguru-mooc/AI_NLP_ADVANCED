It might be that pre-back\nproblems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance\ncaused, but now he's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts\nhim. The old saying if you're hot its a trigger mechanism, if you're\ncold, its a hitch. \n\n>First, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,\n>and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.

He changes his stance so much, he loses\ntrack of where the strike zone is. In Wednesday's night game, he was \nclearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to\nme. I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because\nhe's changed his stance so much.\n\nI'm also a bit concerned that because he's got Palmer and Gonzalez hitting\nall the homeruns, he'll become competitive, swing even harder and screw\nhimself up even worse. LaRussa always said that Canseco's famous batting\npractice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged\nbad hitting habits.\n\n\n\n\nRuss Smith\n*******************************************************************************\n\"I don't know anything about X's, but I know about some O.\"              \n                  George Gervin on being an assistant coach\n********************************************************************************","completion":"baseball"}

The referee originally \nsignalled no goal but the video replay \"judges\" initiated contact with\nthe referee to claim that a goal was in fact scored.  This, to me, is\nunheard of.

Ville Siren's slap\n shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi\n scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal\n put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.\n The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo\n made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,\n during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.\n Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to\n Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered\n the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund \n skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.\n Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line\n where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since\n there was traffic in front, 4-3.\n Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan\n and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to\n Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.\n Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only\n 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone \n with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja\n made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.\n The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal\n late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,\n showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck\n and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side.\n But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the\n game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow\n angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.\n\n All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best.\n Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period\n to try no combinations.\n\n Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-\n Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.\n Stillman good on defense.\n Some players aren't good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner\n hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson\n will likely have to leave for NHL pros.\n\n Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the\n Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn't have a very good game, we've seen him\n a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC.\n I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter-\n resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Starting lines:\n\n \tSWEDEN\t\t\t\t\tFINLAND\n\n  35.

The\nargument was\n\n1) Defense, or runs allowed, is 50% of the game.\n2) Unearned runs amount to 12% of the runs allowed; earned runs, 88%.\n\n3) Since unearned runs are the result of fielding, not pitching, and\nearned runs are the product of pitching, not fielding, fielding is 12%\nof defense and pitching is 88% of defense.\n4) Caombining with #1, pitching is 44% of the game, fielding 6%.\n\nPete is usually sharper than that.

Best \nstrategy, given that you don't mind missing the Anthem (which is OK if B.E.\nTaylor decides to come back ever again :) ) is to wait until 7:40 or 7:45,\nwhen the game is rolling; the scalpers are at this point desperate to sell\nand will reduce to near or at face value to get rid of their tickets.\n\n     Playoffs are a little different in that good seats will go early on; \nwhat's left at 7:45 may be nosebleed material (D, E sections).\n\nOthers can add on their opinions as well.\n\nKevin L.

It turns out that the mask is\ncustom-fit to the goalie's face.  The goalie puts his\/her face through a\npiece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the face\nand forehead to show.  Hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plastic\nwrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face.  Then, a\nplaster is spread on their cheeks, forehead, and chin which takes about 12\nminutes to dry sufficiently.  When it dries, it is effectively a mold of the\ngoalie's face.  This is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involves\npadding the inside, hardening the exterior, fitting the cage, etc. etc.  \nJohn Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show. \n\n>He exhibited a couple masks he is currently working on, namely, a\n>new mask for Andy Moog which is a basic re-working of his current\n>mask with the bear on it, and new mask for Bob Essensa which was \n>*really* cool -- the Jets logo was on the chin, and there were two\n>fighter jets on either side on the forehead with an air-brushed\n>back-ground.\n\nYeah, Essensa's mask looked really good.\n \n>The best one of all was one he never talked about, he just held it up.\n>It has the current Leafs crest on the chin and an awesome looking \n>black panther on the forehead -- it *has* to be a new mask for Felix\n>Potvin, but he never said whose it was.\n\nActually, I thought I heard him say that it _was_ Potvin's for certain.

Sorry this is after Opening Day.  I certify that these\nwere completed before the first pitch. :-)\n\nAL East\n1.  New York Yankees - the most (only?) improved team in this division\n2.  Toronto Blue Jays - Stewart and Morris?  No way.\n3.  Milwaukee Brewers - they always seem to do better than I expect\n4.  Baltimore Orioles - Pitching, but Devareaux, Anderson, and Hoiles will drop\n5.  Cleveland Indians - Still don't seem to know what they are doing\n6.  Detroit Tigers - All key players but Fryman are another year past peak\n7.  Boston Red Sox - Any team with Clemens and Viola might be beter than 7th\n\nAl West - this division was the toughest for me to pick.  Whoever of the top\n          4 gets pitching should win it.\n1.  Minnesota Twins - young pitchers seem to have best chance for success\n2.  Texas Rangers - I don't know why I have them here.  Jose Canseco?\n3.  Chicago White Sox - Frank Thomas but no pitching.\n4.  Oakland A's - LaRussa is the best manager and would keep any team close\n5.  Seattle Mariners - I like Pinella, but don't see much here\n6.  Kansas City Royals - will score no runs\n7.  California Angels - will win no games\n\nNL East\n1.  Montreal Expos - good all around, plus no Wallach!\n2.  St. Louis Cardinals - (Jeffries + Whiten) >> (Jose + Clark), no Galarraga\n3.  Pittsburgh Pirates - youngsters will take up more slack than expected\n4.  New York Mets - some good players, still not a \"team\"\n5.  Philadelphia Phillies - they don't impress me\n6.  Florida Marlins - they know what they're doing\n7.  Chicago Cubs - they don't know what they're doing\n\nNL West - The 2 best teams in baseball are in this division.\n1.  Atlanta Braves - Awesome starters, but offense could be a concern\n2.  Cincinnati Reds - Would not surprise me if they won it all\n3.  Houston Astros - Any team that signs Uribe won't contend. Closer to 4 than 2\n4.  San Diego Padres - Plantier could be the Sheffield of 1993\n5.  Los Angeles Dodgers - better pitching than the Giants\n6.  San Francisco Giants - because the Rockies just stink\n7.

I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can\nlook up their minor league stats.

Jay Bell was\ngiven 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what\nyou would expect from his AAA numbers the same season.

However, the next year, at\nage 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job,\nand has been there ever since.  It's really hard for me to see where he\nwould have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was\nperformed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being \"rushed\";\nCleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might have\nbeen less likely to give up on him.\n\nYes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle.

He was a breath of fresh air when he arrived\nin Pittsburgh to the team whose forwards, for the most part, couldn't\nand wouldn't play a lick of defense.\n\nIt's really difficult to assess what the key trades were that brought\nall of this success to the Pens.  You mention Rick Tocchet and he has\ncertainly helped, and even ol' Kjell has been steady.  But looking at\nthis team you could almost take any one of them out of the line-up\npermanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and it\nwouldn't matter.\n\nIf I had to pick the top three acquisitions in recent years they would\nbe 1) Tom Barrasso; 2) Ron Francis; 3) Larry Murphy.  (I'd love to put\nFrancis first but I do think the only thing that could really damage\nthe Pens right now would be to lose Barrasso.)\n\nMom.","completion":"hockey"}
{"prompt":"From: steph@pegasus.cs.uiuc.edu (Dale Stephenson)\nSubject: Hits Stolen -- Second Base 1992\nSummary: Stolen Hits for all second basemen\nKeywords: second defense\nOrganization: University of Illinois, Dept. of Comp. Sci., Urbana, IL\nLines: 117\n\nDisclaimer -- This is for fun.\n\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\n\"stolen hits\", defined as a play made that \"an average fielder would not\nmake with average effort.\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats\nfor the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Kurt\nStillwell would not have made.\"\n\nOK, I realize that's unfair.  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff,\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we\nreplaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% out\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\n\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Double\nPlays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).\n\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\nshould represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don't\ntake it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this\narticle.\n\nThe short version -- definition of terms\nHS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell\nNHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder\nNDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder\nNEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder\nDCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.\nDOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution.\n\nNational League\n\nname            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPS\nAlicea, L.      50    21    2    -1    .160    .865\nSandberg, R.   108    42    1     1    .134   1.015\nThompson, R.    65    20    5    -1    .104    .852\nLind, J.        66     8   -2     1    .027    .571\nDoran, B.       31    -1    4     0    .014    .705\nDeShields, D.   51     1   -2     1   -.002    .755\nHarris, L.      25    -4    0     1   -.019    .602\nLemke, M.       43    -1   -5    -5   -.038    .573\nMorandini, M.   37    -9   -6     0   -.069    .580\nRandolph, W.    13   -16    3    -1   -.088    .582\nBiggio, C.      34   -26   -4     0   -.091    .656\nStillwell, K.    0   -43   -3    -1   -.236    .336\n\nOrdered by DOPS\n\n1.015 Sandberg\n .865 Alicea\n .852 Thompson\n .755 DeShields\n .705 Doran\n .678 *NL Average*\n .656 Biggio\n .602 Harris\n .582 Randolph\n .580 Morandini\n .573 Lemke\n .571 Lind\n .336 Stillwell\n\nAmerican League\n---------------\n\nname            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPS\nFletcher, S.    59    18    5     1    .116    .811\nReed, J.        83    17    3     1    .071    .708\nRipken, B.      56     9   -1    -1    .044    .631\nBaerga, C.      67     0   10     0    .029    .838\nBlankenship, L. 34     2    2     1    .023    .757\nMiller, K.      34    -4    1    -1   -.016    .725\nAlomar, R.      62     4   -9    -2   -.020    .812\nKnoblauch, C.   50   -13    7    -3   -.024    .718\nBordick, M.     37    -4   -2    -1   -.025    .704\nKelly, P.       42    -1   -5    -1   -.039    .636\nWhitaker, L.    40    -8   -1    -2   -.041    .806\nReynolds, H.    47    -6   -5     1   -.043    .603\nSax, S.         56    -6   -9    -1   -.052    .555\nSojo, L.        28   -11   -3     0   -.075    .602\n\nOrder by DOPS\n\n.838 Baerga\n.812 Alomar\n.811 Fletcher\n.806 Whitaker\n.757 Blankenship\n.725 Miller\n.718 Knoblauch\n.708 Reed\n.704 Bordick\n.691 *AL Average*\n.636 Kelly\n.631 Ripken\n.603 Reynolds\n.602 Sojo\n.555 Sax\n\nMore discussion --\n\nDCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)\/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)\/AB)\nWhy such a bizzare formula?

The\n\treporter elaborated on an interview with Ruben Sierra which he\n\tgave in Spanish to a Spanish speaking newspaper reporter with\n\tthe fact that there are maybe 2 major baseball writers that\n\tspeak Spanish, despite the fact that Spanish is one of (if not\n\tthe) easiest languages to learn, so easy that the author Cormac\n\tMcCarthy learned Spanish at age 50 in order to research his\n\tbook, _All The Pretty Horses_.

So who would be better?\n\nUsing Alomar's opportunities (469 groundballs, 73 possible double plays)\nAlomar had 332 groundouts and turned 18 DPs.\nBaerga would have had (with same DA & DP%) 328 groundouts and 35 DPs.\n\nUsing Baerga's opportunites (545 groundballs, 99 possible double plays).\nAlomar would have had (with the same DA & DP%) 386 groundouts and 25 DPs.\nBaerga had 381 groundouts and 47 DPs.\n\nBaerga looks better, though it's possible his DP% would be lower with a \ndifferent SS.\n\nWill Baerga consistently turn twice as many double plays, however?  Alomar\nhas established a high level of defense, Baerga has not.  I would bet on\nAlomar to be better next year, but last year Baerga was just as good overall.\n-- \nDale J.

There is only one way of determin-\ning \"best\" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at\nthe  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best\nthat day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the\nmost  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the\nbest of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro-\ncess  used to determine the \"best\" is the score of the game and it re-\nlates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method\ninherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that\nis how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.\n\nTo say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-\nsolutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B\nin their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.\n\nIf you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has\ndone  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you\nhave  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the\nindividual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the\nonly measure of \"best\" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base-\nball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham-\npionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub-\njective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can\npredict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.\n\n>The fact is that Morris didn't \"win\" any ballgames, Toronto did, in\n>spite of Morris' \"contribution\".   This has been explained to you\n\nExactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  with\nClemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens.\nI am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally\nmeaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on\nhis ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.\n\n>many, many times and you are either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp it.\n\nYou don't have to be rude.\n\n>You are completely consumed by the post hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy.\n\nFor you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point\nof  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio\nElenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because\nhe   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed\nthat in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an\nindividual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose of\ncomparing that individual's performance with another individual's per-\nformance.\n\nThe stats are a nice hobby and  that's  about  it.  There  is  no  new\nknowledge being produced.  So when a poster claims that Morris is better\nthan Clemens because he has more rings, the poster is no more nor less \nincorrect than the rest of you baying hounds.\n\n-- \n\ncordially, as always,                      maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca \n                                           \"So many morons...\nrm                                                   ...and so little time.\"","completion":"baseball"}

{"prompt":"From: seth@cbnewsh.cb.att.com (peter.r.clark..jr)\nSubject: FLYERS notes 4\/16\nOrganization: AT&T\nKeywords: FLYERS\/Sabres summary, misc stuff\nLines: 283\n\n\nThe FLYERS blew a 3-0 lead over the Buffalo Sabres in the second period, but\nKevin Dineen's 7th career hat trick powered them to their 7th consecutive win,\n7-4 over the Sabres who have now lost 7 in a row. Alexander Mogilny led the\ncomeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at\n3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd. Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shots\non goal to improve his own record to 20-17-6 as he was tested by Mogilny and\nLaFontaine all night.\n\nRoster move:\n\nAndre Faust was once again recalled from Hershey, Shawn Cronin was a healthy\nscratch.\n\nLines:\n\nEklund-Lindros-Recchi\nBeranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\nFaust-Acton-Brown\n\nGalley-Bowen\nYushkevich-Hawgood\nCarkner-McGill\n\nTommy Soderstrom\n\nGame Summary:\n\nSay, if anybody from Buffalo is reading this, where did you people get that\nwoman who sang the anthems? We had to turn down the volume!\n\nThe FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have\nbeen shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the\nfirst period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday\nwhen they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them that\nhe was getting bored back there...\n\nMark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. After\nBuffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards\nto Eric 1\/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it ahead\nto Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passed\nthe puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him and\nin on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his\nstick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to the\nright past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18. It was so beautiful Eric and\nGarry should turn down their assists :-).\n\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strong\nand kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensive\nstruggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when\nTerry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into\nthe boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and not\na terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny got\na post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.\n\nKeith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi to\ngive the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the league\ndidn't allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create a\ngood scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towards\nthe end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody kept\nmissing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give\nthe Sabres another power play, but they couldn't get anything going and the\nfans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shots\nwere 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.\n\nMike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay was\ndisappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considered\na rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the\nseason went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was\nRuss Farwell's trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and Ed\nSnider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and they'd do\nit all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for\nnext year he said that it's Russ' call, and Russ will evaluate things at the\nend of the season. He feels that they're 3 years away from a shot at the Cup.\nHe expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division title\nthe following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This based\non the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.\n\nHe's very happy with the re-alignment (he called it \"outstanding\"). Happy with\nthe current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux\nof Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable.\nSeemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that there\nwas a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in\nfour years if there was a consensus.\n\nThe Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May\ntook a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little trouble\ngetting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was moving\nthroug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres\nblue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passed\nacross to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the\ntop of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling\nthrough the slot. Fuhr didn't know where it was, though, and Hawgood won the\nrace to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.\n\nThen Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line\nand went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom was\nall over it.\n\nThe FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them.\nViacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when\nBarnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefer\ntook a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. The Sabres coudln't\nget started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the\nFLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and\nheaded the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind'Amour hustled ahead to\nmake it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the top\nof the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40. That was all for Fuhr, John\nMuckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.\n\nBut the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time to\njust get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were all\nover them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got through\nSoderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that\nmissed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander as\nhe skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it.\nMistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried\nabout A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right\nnext to the net. Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, and\nmistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the\npuck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didn't even swing his\nstick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal, at 7:48, two streaks\nend for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills.\n\nLindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking\nminor, I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to get\nset up quickly, but couldn't get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continued\nto keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended.\nThings evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. McGill\nallowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a\nfaceoff. The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out of\nhim. But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and\nthat meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major,\n7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15, Barnaby only got 5.\n\nThe FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long\nthey could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed to\nLedyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by\nSoderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of\nthe net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom had\nmoved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving\nat the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty net\nat 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2. LaFontaine was actually trying to\nput it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.\n\nThe FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasek\nwas strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the\nneutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS\nblue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from the\nleft circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at\n18:56 for his 75th of the season. Ironically, the youth hockey tip between\nthe 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off\nangles...\n\nThat was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.\n\nInto the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the\nFLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund in\nthe slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until\nhe had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot, he\nhit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time.\n\nThan an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood\nuntouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck under\nSoderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on,\nhorn sounds, crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth, for some strange\nreason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they\ncould be reviewing. Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade\nthat went into the net, not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteria\nfor scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...\n\nDave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35. The FLYERS\ncould not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1\/2 way through,\nbut were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puck\nfrom a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across\nto Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net\njust inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass,\nbut twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing\npuck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS.\n\nBut the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive\nleft corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skate\nout, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flew\nin, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom's 5 hole for his 76th at\n5:24 to tie the game at 4.\n\nThen Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55. The FLYERS set up\nin the Sabres zone, and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in\nthe middle. While Brind'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through the\nline and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek's glove side at 6:44.\n\nPlay started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19.\nThe FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. Brind'Amour and Ledyard went\nafter it, and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards, skated\nto the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing\nthrough the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over\nthe blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the season\nfor Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th\nof the season.\n\nThen Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres\npower play. Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of the\nchances on the FLYERS resulting power play.\n\nPlay went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to\nmake some big saves. The Sabres weren't able to pull Hasek as time was running \nout as the FLYERS wouldn't allow any consistant possession for the Sabres.\nFinally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left\ncorner and Brind'Amour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and found\nDineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at the\nright of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Acton\nchipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48\non his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo,\nand the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the\ngame.\n\nSo another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn't been tested much\nin his last couple of starts. Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night\n(unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I don't think so).\nThe FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 against\nwith three shutouts. Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals\ndespite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th place\nsince the Rangers lose the tie breaker.\n\nA couple misc notes:\n\nForget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow to\nannounce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year.\n\nIn the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award,\nbut I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.\n\nThe Times of Trenton has reported that \"a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma\"\nhas looked over Tommy Soderstrom's medical record and determined that no\nfurther tests are necessary in the near future.\n\nSame paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he\nexpected to be back next year. His response was that he wants to come back,\nhe feels he did a good job this year, but that he would cheerfully accept a\nrole scouting if Farwell didn't want him back.\n\nFLYERS team record watch:\n\nEric Lindros:\n\n41 goals, 33 assists, 74 points\n\n(rookie records)\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nEric Lindros\t40 1992-93\t\tDave Poulin\t76 1983-84\nBrian Propp\t34 1979-80\t\tBrian Propp\t75 1979-80\nRon Flockhart\t33 1981-82\t\tEric Lindros\t74 1992-93\nDave Poulin\t31 1983-84\t\tRon Flockhart\t72 1981-82\nBill Barber\t30 1972-73\t\tPelle Eklund\t66 1985-86\n\nMark Recchi:\n\n52 goals, 69 assists, 121 points.\n\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nReggie Leach\t61 1975-76\t\tMark Recchi\t121 1992-93*\nTim Kerr\t58 1985-86,86-87\tBobby Clarke\t119 1975-76\nTim Kerr\t54 1983-84,84-85\tBobby Clarke\t116 1974-75\nMark Recchi\t52 1992-93\t\tBill Barber\t112 1975-76\nRick Macliesh\t50 1972-73\t\tBobby Clarke\t104 1972-73\nBill Barber\t50 1975-76\t\tRick Macliesh\t100 1972-73\nReggie Leach\t50 1979-80\n\n*More than 80 games.\n\nFLYERS career years:\n\nPlayer\t\tPoints\tBest Prior Season\nMark Recchi\t121\t113 (90-91 Penguins)\nRod Brind'Amour\t84\t77 (91-92 FLYERS)\nGarry Galley\t62\t38 (84-85 Kings)\nBrent Fedyk\t59\t35 (90-91 Red Wings)\n\nThat's all for now...\n\npete clark jr - rsh FLYERS contact and mailing list owner","completion":"hockey"}

Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom \n played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up\n Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge\n to Sweden in creating more opportunities.\n Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi\n made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but\n Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada\n started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked\n hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson\n who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and\n made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada.\n The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot\n that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.\n Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took\n a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by\n the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1.\n Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure\n but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal.\n At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to\n cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it.\n That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in \n the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he\n explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close\n to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal.\n Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a\n bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas\n then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.\n The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a\n rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds\n in the dressing room.\n\n A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing\n great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better\n than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best\n goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.\n Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is\n easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well,\n Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.\n\n The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden's best along with Larsson-Juhlin-\n Nilsson. Swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the\n task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros, and managed this very well.\n Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC, and considering\n that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game, he played very\n well. Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because\n of the Swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesman's mistake\n on the 1-3 goal.\n\n Lines information follows further below.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n ITALY - SWITZERLAND  1-0 (0-0,1-0,0-0)\n\n 1st:\n 2nd: ITA 1-0 Orlando          15:47\n 3rd:\n\n Penalties: ITA 10*2min, SWI 8*2min\n Referee: Anton Danko, Slovakia\n Attendance: 3,500\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Group B results:\n\n CZECH REPUBLIC - GERMANY  5-0 (0-0,3-0,2-0)\n\n 1st:\n 2nd: CZE 1-0 Kamil Kastak        1:51\n      CZE 2-0 Jiri Dolezal       12:26\n      CZE 3-0 Petr Hrbek         19:10\n 3rd: CZE 4-0 Radek Toupal        8:28\n      CZE 5-0 Josef Beranek      17:07\n\n Penalties: CZE 7*2min, GER 6*2min 1*5min 1*10min game penalty\n Referee: Darren Loraas, Canada\n Attendance: 10,200\n\n The Czechs were clearly better than the Germans, and the German crowd\n showed their discontent by throwing in stuff on the ice after a while.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n FINLAND - USA  1-1 (0-0,1-0,0-1)\n\n 1st:\n 2nd: FIN 1-0 Jarkko Varvio      4:00\n 3rd: USA 1-1 Ed Olczyk          4:26\n\n Penalties: FIN 7*2min, USA 6*2min\n Referee: Valeri Bokarev, Russia\n Attendance: 2,800\n\n I hope some Finns can provide information from this game (I didn't see the\n whole game).

Ahola had\nonly played 50 games this season (I think it's actually less; the San Jose\nMercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he\nhas played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn't been\nspectacular, and his offense isn't anything to write home about (8 points);\nit's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn\nout to be ... Peter Ahola.\n\n#24\tDOUG WILSON\t\tSeason: 16th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and\n\t\t2nd round pick in '92 entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (B)\n\nI have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high\nexpectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out.\nNevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and\nplaymaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which,\nunfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to\ncatch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for\n2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be\nWilson's last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.\n\n#29\tDEAN KOLSTAD\t\tSeason:\t2nd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (C-\/D+)\n\nIt's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of\ngames (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he's\nquickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games,\nhe did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of\nthe first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with\nthe Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward\nwith his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in\nhis level of performance to have any chance of making the team.\n\n#38\tPAT MACLEOD\t\tSeason: 2nd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nMacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my\nmemory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to\nuse him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that\nhe wouldn't clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with\nKansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment,\na \"rehab assignment\" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs.\nSince he has played so little, I can't even give a tentative grade on him, but\nhe demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive\nskills.\n\n#41\tTOM PEDERSON\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (B+)\n\nCalled up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated\nby injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours\ntruly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in\n43 games.  However, his size (5' 9\", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after\nhe began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically,\non both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach.\nBut to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance\non surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.\n\n#45\tCLAUDIO SCREMIN\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (D+\/D)\n\nHe played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly\numimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a\nsmall sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is\nquickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or\ndefense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that\nwill go down in Scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he\nwas once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.\n\n===============================================================================\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

{"prompt":"From: fierkelab@bchm.biochem.duke.edu (Eric Roush)\nSubject: Re: Young Catchers\nArticle-I.D.: news.12799\nOrganization: Biochemistry\nLines: 139\nNntp-Posting-Host: bruchner.biochem.duke.edu\n\nSince I was the one responsible for these divergent threads of\napprox. 40+ posts (going back to: The Braves could be better off\nif an injury happens), I may as well inject a little more\nfuel to the flame!\n\n1)  Back at the beginning of Spring Training, I though\nLopez would make the squad easily.  Olson was still\nrecovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe),\nand there were questions as to whether he would be\nable to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.\n\nI was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez\ncan hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was\nthe Braves \"Defensive Catcher\" prospect, while Brian Deak was\nthe Braves \"Offensive Catcher\" prospect.  Besides, Olson\nand Berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboard\nbox, and don't walk enough to be useful.\n\nBut Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went\nwith the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down\nat the start of the season, he wouldn't have gotten his job back.\n\n2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around.\nAfter all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and\ntear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher\n(California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to\nmove Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.\nPlus, you'd have to eat that salary, which isn't huge, but isn't\ntiddleywinks either (I think Olson's at about $800,000, Berryhill\nat $450,000, but that's only what I recall).\n\n3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to\nplay in this also.  What is it, that 5\/6 of the 2+year players\naren't eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1\/6 that were on the roster\nthe longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change,\nbut the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business\nstandpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June\/the\nfirst time Olson\/Berryhill go on the DL.\n\n4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn't on the team.\nI still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves,\nand the truth is that I'd rather see our best team on the field,\nwhich, IMO, includes Lopez.\n\nOf course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won't need him. ;)\n\nAs for the Schuerholz\/Cox conversation, I imagine it went\nlike this:  (Remember, they've BOTH been GM's)\n(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)\n\nCox:  OK, we've sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a\nlittle smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding\nis better than it used to be.\n\nSchuerholz:  Well, we'll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion\njust won't sign that baseball only contract.  We can't count\non him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the\ndefense.  Besides, Gorman's not ready to give up on\nBilly Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher's gone AND Deion signs,\nwe can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to\ngive us some pitching depth in 1995.\n\nCox:  Yep, that'll be nice.  Too bad Deion won't sign.\nOK, I'll look for Nieves when Justice starts having\nBerry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about\nKlesko?\n\nSchuerholz:  Well, we've still got to fork out another 1.5 mil\nfor Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money\nor Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell,\nbut somehow he doesn't seem to be the same GM.  First\nJeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he\ngets rid of Brian Jordan, then I'd HAVE to believe that he\nand Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!\n\nCox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I'll wait til the trading\ndeadline for my Hunter\/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few\nextra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California...\nif Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid.\nAnd if that doesn't work, then perhaps Sid's knees\ncould be \"persuaded\" to act up.  There's always the\n15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!\n\nSchuerholz:  What about Caraballo?\n\nCox:  Well, he's not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts\nin Richmond, he'll start walking more.  Besides, if he's going to be\narbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually\nget some value from him before he makes the big bucks.\n\nSchuerholz:  Now, let's see.  That leaves Lopez.\n\nCox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn't think Olson\nwould recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into\nrunning into him again?\n\nSchuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he'll get\n$3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one\nextra year.  Besides, until Olson's shown his stuff a little\nbit, I can't trade him.  Besides, Berryhill's a left-handed\nhitter.  You know how rare that is?\n\nCox:  Don't you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common,\nif you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in\nthe World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!\n\nSchuerholz:  Hey, you're the one who wouldn't write Lopez\ninto the lineup.\n\nCox:  Well, you're the one who went out and got me Jeff\nReardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn't be used\nto our pitching staff's stuff.  He got some time with\nthem this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely\nwe only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?\n\nSchuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep\nwill be hurt by May.\n\nCox:  OK, OK, you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surely\none of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I\ncan call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant!\nTHE WORLD SERIES!  I'll be up there with John McGraw!  Casey\nStengel!  Earl Weaver!  Oh, they laughed at me in Toronto,\nbut have you ever had to deal with George Bell?  I'll finally\nget my just reward!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha!\n\nSchuerholz:  Easy, Bobby.  Have you been taking those\n\"happy pills\" left around by Chuck Tanner?  Why'd you\never hire that guy anyhow?\n\nCox:  Don't ask me; ask Ted.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nEric Roush\t\tfierkelab@\tbchm.biochem.duke.edu\n\"I am a Marxist, of the Groucho sort\"\nGrafitti, Paris, 1968\n\nTANSTAAFL!

It was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win Monday and five in\nthe 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday. Jamie Navarro pitched\nseven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part\nin the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado has\npitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next lowest\non the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!\n\nIt doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, while\nThon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The next\nbest hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at\n.238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team\nis 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs\/game\nand giving up 6.6\/game. \n\nStill, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should\ncome around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave\nthe Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo, \nFetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be\nsuccessful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either\nheld small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay,\nthe defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen\nis a big question mark.\n\nIn other news, Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday, while William\nSuero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal.

My suggestion would be Shjon Podein, one of the\ncallups from Cape Breton during the year.  He was quite far down on the\ndepth chart in the Oilers stable of prospects, but made a big impact on\nthe team.  He has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only -1.

Another single made the score 2-0 Cards.\n \nLasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler, Reed, And Piazza\nbatting third!  Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder\nand Webster.\n \nPiazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards.\nThe Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single\nby Offerman.\n \nBy the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, but\nthe score was still 2-2.  The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive\nplays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner\ntrying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who\nhad strayed a bit from first base, etc.\n \nKarros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into\nthe outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going\nthrough, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threw\nto third and EASILY got the runner at third.\n \nMy heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen.\n \nAstacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the game\nwith the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over.\n \nGross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1\/3\ninnings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inning\ngame had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was fresh\ngiven his light work out Tuesday.\n \nGross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hit\nto the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resulted\nin a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it\n3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next\nthing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner on\nfirst was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had\nscored long before that.\n \nMeanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning.\nLee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karros\nand Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?).\nCory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, but\nthat was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got his\nthird straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my\nfree Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps this\nup all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year\nhonors.  Though its really early, Karros is already showing signs\nof a sophomore jinx year.\n \nThe final score...Cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits.\nDodgers 2 runs on 7 hits.\n \nDodger","completion":"baseball"}

After \nthe game, her coach, Gene Ubriaco, said Rheaume performed well enough to \ncompete for the No. 2 goalie spot with the Louisville IceHawks of the East \nCoast Hockey League next season. The Knights and the IceHawks are minor \nleague clubs of the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n**\n  As their first season comes to a close, there are rumors swirling that \nthe Tampa Bay Lightning just might become the Atlanta Lightning.  Or the \nMinnesota Lightning.  But they are just rumors, according to Lightning \ngeneral manager Phil Esposito.

Matchups will be based on overall points with the \nfour division champions being placed in the first- or second-place seeds \nin each conference and being assured of home-ice in the first two playoff \nrounds. All series will be best of seven (2-2-1-1-1 rotation) except \nmatchups between Central and Pacific teams.  Those series will rotate 2-3-\n2 to reduce travel.

A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose, Tampa \nBay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two \nnew teams.\n        Ottawa, Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority \ndrafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst \nrecords. Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth. The \nexpansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose, \nTampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions.\n        The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry \nDraft, regardless of their finish in 1993-94. Should either of the two new \nteams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in \n1994.\n\n        The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the \n1995 draft in Winnipeg. The 1994 draft was scheduled for Boston, but a \ndelay in the construction of a new arena required the draft be moved.\n\n-----\n \n- League news:\n\nDisputes:\n\n  The NHL owners and players have resolved differences over salary \narbitration procedures, clearing the way for about 40 hearings.

Answers to some frequently asked questions:\n \n Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?\n A: Most of the team during the 40-50's was made up of people who lived in \nand around Montreal.

Short-\nhanded goals do count for +\/-.\n \n Q: What is the five-hole?\n A: The space between a goalie's pads. There are five major scoring zones: \n(1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower \nright, and (5) five-hole.\n \n Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?\n A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950's when two best-of-seven \nseries were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a \ngame, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.\n\n Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?\n A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever \nto play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for \nthe expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis \nBlues. Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat \nExpo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine \nshots. She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately \nlost the game, 6-4.\n\n Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history?\n A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed \nthe richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be \nworth about $42 million. Lemieux will earn between $6 million and $7 \nmillion a year, nearly twice as much as any other player in the league.\n\n Q: Who is the new commissioner of the NHL?\n A: Gary Bettman, vice president and general counsel of the National \nBasketball Association, was named commissioner of the National Hockey \nLeague, Friday, December 11, 1992.

The Braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid\n>>abilities to call games, to work with the pitchers, to throw out\n>>runners.  \n\n\tThis is the crux of the argument (to me at least).  Both the\nSDCN and the non-SDCN camps seem to agree on the fact that a catcher's\ndefense is basically nonmeasurable at present.  You can talk about how\nimportant calling a game is, or framing the pitches, or blocking balls\nin the dirt.  But there is little or no way to tell exactly how various\ncatcher's rank in \"defense\".  \n\n\tLooking at Lopez specifically; is there any reason to suspect\nthat he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the Braves\n(or the media) has labeled him a bad defensive catcher?  As far as I\ncan tell he doesn't have any particular problem in his mechanics\n(such as Sasser).  He might be a little rough around the edges in blocking\nthe ball, or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to\nclear that up is playing and practice time.  I can't see how repetitions\nat AAA are any better then reps in the majors!  \n\n\tAll we're left with is the calling the game aspect.  Olsen  and\nBerryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping\nthe pitchering staff.  But this is a reputation that is given to almost\nall veteran catchers.  How is catching at AAA going to help Lopez learn\nthe major league pitching staff?  The only way any catcher is going to\nlearn Tom Glavine's pitches is to catch Tom Glavine.  Similarly, I wouldn't\nbe supprised if the pitcher's claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen over\npitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen.  But \ngiven time they will say they are comfortable with Lopez.\n\n\tNow, since Lopez can't learn how to handle the major league\npitcher's while he's in AAA and since he doesn't have any glaring\nproblem in his mechanics, what is he going to learn in AAA that he\ncan't learn just as well while in the majors?  \n\nDave\n__________\nDave Bonar\nmebonar@lsuvax.sncc.lsu.edu\n__________","completion":"baseball"}
