Sorry this is after Opening Day.  I certify that these\nwere completed before the first pitch. :-)\n\nAL East\n1.  New York Yankees - the most (only?) improved team in this division\n2.  Toronto Blue Jays - Stewart and Morris?  No way.\n3.  Milwaukee Brewers - they always seem to do better than I expect\n4.  Baltimore Orioles - Pitching, but Devareaux, Anderson, and Hoiles will drop\n5.  Cleveland Indians - Still don't seem to know what they are doing\n6.  Detroit Tigers - All key players but Fryman are another year past peak\n7.  Boston Red Sox - Any team with Clemens and Viola might be beter than 7th\n\nAl West - this division was the toughest for me to pick.  Whoever of the top\n          4 gets pitching should win it.\n1.  Minnesota Twins - young pitchers seem to have best chance for success\n2.  Texas Rangers - I don't know why I have them here.  Jose Canseco?\n3.  Chicago White Sox - Frank Thomas but no pitching.\n4.  Oakland A's - LaRussa is the best manager and would keep any team close\n5.  Seattle Mariners - I like Pinella, but don't see much here\n6.  Kansas City Royals - will score no runs\n7.  California Angels - will win no games\n\nNL East\n1.  Montreal Expos - good all around, plus no Wallach!\n2.  St. Louis Cardinals - (Jeffries + Whiten) >> (Jose + Clark), no Galarraga\n3.  Pittsburgh Pirates - youngsters will take up more slack than expected\n4.  New York Mets - some good players, still not a \"team\"\n5.  Philadelphia Phillies - they don't impress me\n6.  Florida Marlins - they know what they're doing\n7.  Chicago Cubs - they don't know what they're doing\n\nNL West - The 2 best teams in baseball are in this division.\n1.  Atlanta Braves - Awesome starters, but offense could be a concern\n2.  Cincinnati Reds - Would not surprise me if they won it all\n3.  Houston Astros - Any team that signs Uribe won't contend. Closer to 4 than 2\n4.  San Diego Padres - Plantier could be the Sheffield of 1993\n5.  Los Angeles Dodgers - better pitching than the Giants\n6.  San Francisco Giants - because the Rockies just stink\n7.  Colorado Rockies - will become the Seattle Mariners of the NL.\n\n\nNLCS  Montreal d.

Last time they beat the B's 5-2 but Boston had a clear\nterritorial advantage; the victory was Roy's.  At the same time, I can't\nbring myself to predict the possibility of a loss, so I'll just say I will\nnot be putting money on this series. :-)\n\n>Patrick Division, semifinal\n\n>Pittsburgh vs. NY Islanders:\n>What can I say?

The Penguins are just as good as 12 months ago,\n>and the Bruins are much improved. But... PENGUINS IN 6.\n\nIf Pittsburgh plays Boston, IMO they win in likely five, possibly six.  They\nown the Bruins.  If they play Montreal, I think it will go to seven, and once\nagain I won't be putting money on the seventh game.  I say seven because the\nHabs have played Pittsburgh very tough this season.\n\n>Campbell Conference, Norris Division, semifinal\n\n>Chicago vs. St. Louis (or Minnesota):\n> BLACKHAWKS IN 5.\n\nChicago will win, but I think in at least six.  Chicago is not that good,\nIMO.

RED WINGS IN 5.\n\nVery true.  The Leafs have much to be proud of, but they will soon find out\nwhy Montreal did so lousy in the playoffs.  Toronto might win two or three \nat MLG though.  Wings in six, maybe even seven.\n\n>FINAL:\n>Chicago vs. Detroit:\n> This will be a war. Fedorov will win it in OT. RED WINGS IN 7.\n\nIt _will_ be a war...possibly the most intense playoff series of them all. \nAnd yes, I think Detroit will win.  Probert will have to come up big though.\n\n>Smythe Division SEMI-FINALS:\n\n>Vancouver vs. Winnipeg:\n> CANUCKS IN 7.\n\nOur first disagreement.  Canucks are playing like shit.  They don't use their\nsize *at* *all*, which may explain why they get hammered 8-1 by a team\nchasing them (Calgary)....Winnipeg in six.\n\n>Calgary vs. Los Angeles:\n>This would have been tough to call, except for three things. 1\/ The\n>Kings don't have a goalie; 2\/ Gary Roberts will be back; 3\/ the Kings\n>shot themselves in the foot by trading a proven winner (Paul Coffey)\n>for a proven loser (Jimmy Carson). Gretzky is just too weary to carry\n>this group. FLAMES IN 5.\n\nThis is also tough for me to call, because I haven't seen the Smythe enough. \nI don't think Roberts will be well enough to figure in, Coffey is a\nnon-issue, who cares what Carson has done before, and *never* underestimate\nGretzky.  LA in six.\n\n>FINAL:\n>Vancouver vs. Calgary:\n> FLAMES IN 6.\n\nIf it is these two, Calgary will not need six games.  But I think it will be\nLA-Winnipeg anyway, and LA in seven, because of home ice.\n\n>COFERENCE FINAL:\n>Detroit vs. Calgary:\n> RED WINGS IN 7.\n\nWow, must've been tough to go against your team.

They are very strong, IMO, and nobody knows *how* strong\nbecause they've been underachieving most of the year.  If forced to choose,\nthough, I'd have to take the Penguins.\n\nA side note.  Vlad, last week you said that Selanne was a better player than\nGilmour.  NO WAY.  He is a more talented pure goal scorer...but aside from\nthe age difference, there is no way I would take him over Gilmour on my team.\nI'm not asking for flames, either, btw....I've spent more than enough time\narguing on behalf of Selanne and I still say he's a great player.  But while\nhe and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give Teemu an edge),\nGilmour *does* *it* *all*.  I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on, esp.\nfrom Flame fans.  But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloud\nyour judgement when it comes to his skill.

Another single made the score 2-0 Cards.\n \nLasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler, Reed, And Piazza\nbatting third!  Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder\nand Webster.\n \nPiazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards.\nThe Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single\nby Offerman.\n \nBy the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, but\nthe score was still 2-2.  The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive\nplays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner\ntrying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who\nhad strayed a bit from first base, etc.\n \nKarros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into\nthe outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going\nthrough, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threw\nto third and EASILY got the runner at third.\n \nMy heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen.\n \nAstacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the game\nwith the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over.\n \nGross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1\/3\ninnings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inning\ngame had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was fresh\ngiven his light work out Tuesday.\n \nGross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hit\nto the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resulted\nin a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it\n3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next\nthing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner on\nfirst was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had\nscored long before that.\n \nMeanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning.\nLee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karros\nand Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?).\nCory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, but\nthat was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got his\nthird straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my\nfree Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps this\nup all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year\nhonors.  Though its really early, Karros is already showing signs\nof a sophomore jinx year.\n \nThe final score...Cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits.\nDodgers 2 runs on 7 hits.\n \nDodger\n\n###\n\n","completion":" baseball"}

Too bad they couldn't have saved some of the 15 or so runs they\nscored on Saturday when they crushed St. Louis.\n--\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nneal\ttraven+@pitt.edu\t      You're only young once, but you can be\n\ttraven@vms.cis.pitt.edu\t       immature forever.   -- Larry Andersen\n\n###\n\n","completion":" baseball"}

It turns out that the mask is\ncustom-fit to the goalie's face.  The goalie puts his\/her face through a\npiece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the face\nand forehead to show.  Hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plastic\nwrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face.  Then, a\nplaster is spread on their cheeks, forehead, and chin which takes about 12\nminutes to dry sufficiently.  When it dries, it is effectively a mold of the\ngoalie's face.  This is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involves\npadding the inside, hardening the exterior, fitting the cage, etc. etc.  \nJohn Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show. \n\n>He exhibited a couple masks he is currently working on, namely, a\n>new mask for Andy Moog which is a basic re-working of his current\n>mask with the bear on it, and new mask for Bob Essensa which was \n>*really* cool -- the Jets logo was on the chin, and there were two\n>fighter jets on either side on the forehead with an air-brushed\n>back-ground.\n\nYeah, Essensa's mask looked really good.\n \n>The best one of all was one he never talked about, he just held it up.\n>It has the current Leafs crest on the chin and an awesome looking \n>black panther on the forehead -- it *has* to be a new mask for Felix\n>Potvin, but he never said whose it was.\n\nActually, I thought I heard him say that it _was_ Potvin's for certain.

Ville Siren's slap\n shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi\n scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal\n put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.\n The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo\n made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,\n during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.\n Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to\n Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered\n the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund \n skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.\n Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line\n where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since\n there was traffic in front, 4-3.\n Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan\n and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to\n Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.\n Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only\n 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone \n with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja\n made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.\n The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal\n late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,\n showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck\n and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side.\n But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the\n game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow\n angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.\n\n All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best.\n Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period\n to try no combinations.\n\n Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-\n Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.\n Stillman good on defense.\n Some players aren't good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner\n hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson\n will likely have to leave for NHL pros.\n\n Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the\n Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn't have a very good game, we've seen him\n a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC.\n I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter-\n resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Starting lines:\n\n \tSWEDEN\t\t\t\t\tFINLAND\n\n  35.

This time, Buck thinks, \"I don't want a repeat of that\nnear-fiasco with Wickman, so I'll give my bullpen some work.\" Steve Howe,\nwhose ERA was 54.00 coming into the game, left with it at 81.00.

{"prompt":"From: steph@pegasus.cs.uiuc.edu (Dale Stephenson)\nSubject: Hits Stolen -- Second Base 1992\nSummary: Stolen Hits for all second basemen\nKeywords: second defense\nOrganization: University of Illinois, Dept. of Comp. Sci., Urbana, IL\nLines: 117\n\nDisclaimer -- This is for fun.\n\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\n\"stolen hits\", defined as a play made that \"an average fielder would not\nmake with average effort.\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats\nfor the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Kurt\nStillwell would not have made.\"\n\nOK, I realize that's unfair.  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff,\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we\nreplaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% out\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\n\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Double\nPlays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).\n\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\nshould represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don't\ntake it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this\narticle.\n\nThe short version -- definition of terms\nHS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell\nNHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder\nNDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder\nNEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder\nDCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.\nDOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution.\n\nNational League\n\nname            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPS\nAlicea, L.      50    21    2    -1    .160    .865\nSandberg, R.   108    42    1     1    .134   1.015\nThompson, R.    65    20    5    -1    .104    .852\nLind, J.        66     8   -2     1    .027    .571\nDoran, B.       31    -1    4     0    .014    .705\nDeShields, D.   51     1   -2     1   -.002    .755\nHarris, L.      25    -4    0     1   -.019    .602\nLemke, M.       43    -1   -5    -5   -.038    .573\nMorandini, M.   37    -9   -6     0   -.069    .580\nRandolph, W.    13   -16    3    -1   -.088    .582\nBiggio, C.      34   -26   -4     0   -.091    .656\nStillwell, K.    0   -43   -3    -1   -.236    .336\n\nOrdered by DOPS\n\n1.015 Sandberg\n .865 Alicea\n .852 Thompson\n .755 DeShields\n .705 Doran\n .678 *NL Average*\n .656 Biggio\n .602 Harris\n .582 Randolph\n .580 Morandini\n .573 Lemke\n .571 Lind\n .336 Stillwell\n\nAmerican League\n---------------\n\nname            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPS\nFletcher, S.    59    18    5     1    .116    .811\nReed, J.        83    17    3     1    .071    .708\nRipken, B.      56     9   -1    -1    .044    .631\nBaerga, C.      67     0   10     0    .029    .838\nBlankenship, L. 34     2    2     1    .023    .757\nMiller, K.      34    -4    1    -1   -.016    .725\nAlomar, R.      62     4   -9    -2   -.020    .812\nKnoblauch, C.   50   -13    7    -3   -.024    .718\nBordick, M.     37    -4   -2    -1   -.025    .704\nKelly, P.       42    -1   -5    -1   -.039    .636\nWhitaker, L.    40    -8   -1    -2   -.041    .806\nReynolds, H.    47    -6   -5     1   -.043    .603\nSax, S.         56    -6   -9    -1   -.052    .555\nSojo, L.        28   -11   -3     0   -.075    .602\n\nOrder by DOPS\n\n.838 Baerga\n.812 Alomar\n.811 Fletcher\n.806 Whitaker\n.757 Blankenship\n.725 Miller\n.718 Knoblauch\n.708 Reed\n.704 Bordick\n.691 *AL Average*\n.636 Kelly\n.631 Ripken\n.603 Reynolds\n.602 Sojo\n.555 Sax\n\nMore discussion --\n\nDCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)\/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)\/AB)\nWhy such a bizzare formula?

Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom \n played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up\n Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge\n to Sweden in creating more opportunities.\n Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi\n made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but\n Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada\n started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked\n hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson\n who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and\n made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada.\n The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot\n that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.\n Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took\n a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by\n the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1.\n Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure\n but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal.\n At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to\n cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it.\n That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in \n the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he\n explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close\n to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal.\n Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a\n bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas\n then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.\n The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a\n rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds\n in the dressing room.\n\n A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing\n great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better\n than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best\n goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.\n Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is\n easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well,\n Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.\n\n The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden's best along with Larsson-Juhlin-\n Nilsson. Swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the\n task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros, and managed this very well.\n Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC, and considering\n that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game, he played very\n well. Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because\n of the Swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesman's mistake\n on the 1-3 goal.\n\n Lines information follows further below.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n ITALY - SWITZERLAND  1-0 (0-0,1-0,0-0)\n\n 1st:\n 2nd: ITA 1-0 Orlando          15:47\n 3rd:\n\n Penalties: ITA 10*2min, SWI 8*2min\n Referee: Anton Danko, Slovakia\n Attendance: 3,500\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Group B results:\n\n CZECH REPUBLIC - GERMANY  5-0 (0-0,3-0,2-0)\n\n 1st:\n 2nd: CZE 1-0 Kamil Kastak        1:51\n      CZE 2-0 Jiri Dolezal       12:26\n      CZE 3-0 Petr Hrbek         19:10\n 3rd: CZE 4-0 Radek Toupal        8:28\n      CZE 5-0 Josef Beranek      17:07\n\n Penalties: CZE 7*2min, GER 6*2min 1*5min 1*10min game penalty\n Referee: Darren Loraas, Canada\n Attendance: 10,200\n\n The Czechs were clearly better than the Germans, and the German crowd\n showed their discontent by throwing in stuff on the ice after a while.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n FINLAND - USA  1-1 (0-0,1-0,0-1)\n\n 1st:\n 2nd: FIN 1-0 Jarkko Varvio      4:00\n 3rd: USA 1-1 Ed Olczyk          4:26\n\n Penalties: FIN 7*2min, USA 6*2min\n Referee: Valeri Bokarev, Russia\n Attendance: 2,800\n\n I hope some Finns can provide information from this game (I didn't see the\n whole game).

I'm serious; I\ntend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, but\nI'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there are\nany.  I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can\nlook up their minor league stats.  (It's important to distinguish between\nplayers who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers\nwould have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, but\nactually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).  \n\nLet's kick it off with an example of a player who was \"rushed\", although\nthere doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career.  Jay Bell was\ngiven 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what\nyou would expect from his AAA numbers the same season.  He got 236 PAs the\nnext year at age 22, and still underperformed.  However, the next year, at\nage 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job,\nand has been there ever since.  It's really hard for me to see where he\nwould have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was\nperformed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being \"rushed\";\nCleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might have\nbeen less likely to give up on him.\n\nYes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle.  But\ndoes that delay the time at which he stops struggling, and starts\nperforming up to expectations?\n\nSherri Nichols\nsnichols@adobe.com\n\n###\n\n","completion":" baseball"}

The offense should\ncome around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave\nthe Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo, \nFetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be\nsuccessful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either\nheld small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay,\nthe defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen\nis a big question mark.\n\nIn other news, Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday, while William\nSuero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal. Today's game\nwith California was cancelled.\n\n--salty\n\n###\n\n","completion":" baseball"}

{"prompt":"From: fierkelab@bchm.biochem.duke.edu (Eric Roush)\nSubject: Re: Young Catchers\nArticle-I.D.: news.12799\nOrganization: Biochemistry\nLines: 139\nNntp-Posting-Host: bruchner.biochem.duke.edu\n\nSince I was the one responsible for these divergent threads of\napprox. 40+ posts (going back to: The Braves could be better off\nif an injury happens), I may as well inject a little more\nfuel to the flame!\n\n1)  Back at the beginning of Spring Training, I though\nLopez would make the squad easily.  Olson was still\nrecovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe),\nand there were questions as to whether he would be\nable to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.\n\nI was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez\ncan hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was\nthe Braves \"Defensive Catcher\" prospect, while Brian Deak was\nthe Braves \"Offensive Catcher\" prospect.  Besides, Olson\nand Berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboard\nbox, and don't walk enough to be useful.\n\nBut Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went\nwith the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down\nat the start of the season, he wouldn't have gotten his job back.\n\n2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around.\nAfter all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and\ntear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher\n(California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to\nmove Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.\nPlus, you'd have to eat that salary, which isn't huge, but isn't\ntiddleywinks either (I think Olson's at about $800,000, Berryhill\nat $450,000, but that's only what I recall).\n\n3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to\nplay in this also.  What is it, that 5\/6 of the 2+year players\naren't eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1\/6 that were on the roster\nthe longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change,\nbut the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business\nstandpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June\/the\nfirst time Olson\/Berryhill go on the DL.\n\n4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn't on the team.\nI still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves,\nand the truth is that I'd rather see our best team on the field,\nwhich, IMO, includes Lopez.\n\nOf course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won't need him. ;)\n\nAs for the Schuerholz\/Cox conversation, I imagine it went\nlike this:  (Remember, they've BOTH been GM's)\n(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)\n\nCox:  OK, we've sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a\nlittle smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding\nis better than it used to be.\n\nSchuerholz:  Well, we'll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion\njust won't sign that baseball only contract.  We can't count\non him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the\ndefense.  Besides, Gorman's not ready to give up on\nBilly Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher's gone AND Deion signs,\nwe can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to\ngive us some pitching depth in 1995.\n\nCox:  Yep, that'll be nice.  Too bad Deion won't sign.\nOK, I'll look for Nieves when Justice starts having\nBerry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about\nKlesko?\n\nSchuerholz:  Well, we've still got to fork out another 1.5 mil\nfor Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money\nor Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell,\nbut somehow he doesn't seem to be the same GM.  First\nJeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he\ngets rid of Brian Jordan, then I'd HAVE to believe that he\nand Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!\n\nCox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I'll wait til the trading\ndeadline for my Hunter\/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few\nextra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California...\nif Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid.\nAnd if that doesn't work, then perhaps Sid's knees\ncould be \"persuaded\" to act up.  There's always the\n15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!\n\nSchuerholz:  What about Caraballo?\n\nCox:  Well, he's not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts\nin Richmond, he'll start walking more.  Besides, if he's going to be\narbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually\nget some value from him before he makes the big bucks.\n\nSchuerholz:  Now, let's see.  That leaves Lopez.\n\nCox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn't think Olson\nwould recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into\nrunning into him again?\n\nSchuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he'll get\n$3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one\nextra year.  Besides, until Olson's shown his stuff a little\nbit, I can't trade him.  Besides, Berryhill's a left-handed\nhitter.  You know how rare that is?\n\nCox:  Don't you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common,\nif you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in\nthe World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!\n\nSchuerholz:  Hey, you're the one who wouldn't write Lopez\ninto the lineup.\n\nCox:  Well, you're the one who went out and got me Jeff\nReardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn't be used\nto our pitching staff's stuff.  He got some time with\nthem this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely\nwe only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?\n\nSchuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep\nwill be hurt by May.\n\nCox:  OK, OK, you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surely\none of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I\ncan call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant!\nTHE WORLD SERIES!  I'll be up there with John McGraw!  Casey\nStengel!  Earl Weaver!  Oh, they laughed at me in Toronto,\nbut have you ever had to deal with George Bell?  I'll finally\nget my just reward!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha!\n\nSchuerholz:  Easy, Bobby.  Have you been taking those\n\"happy pills\" left around by Chuck Tanner?

It might be that pre-back\nproblems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance\ncaused, but now he's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts\nhim. The old saying if you're hot its a trigger mechanism, if you're\ncold, its a hitch. \n\n>First, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,\n>and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.

He changes his stance so much, he loses\ntrack of where the strike zone is. In Wednesday's night game, he was \nclearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to\nme. I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because\nhe's changed his stance so much.\n\nI'm also a bit concerned that because he's got Palmer and Gonzalez hitting\nall the homeruns, he'll become competitive, swing even harder and screw\nhimself up even worse. LaRussa always said that Canseco's famous batting\npractice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged\nbad hitting habits.\n\n\n\n\nRuss Smith\n*******************************************************************************\n\"I don't know anything about X's, but I know about some O.\"              \n                  George Gervin on being an assistant coach\n********************************************************************************\n\n###\n\n","completion":" baseball"}

Those are decent\nnumbers for a third-line player who was seemingly doomed to minor-league\noblivion.  The Oilers coaching staff likens his style to John Tonelli.\nI think he'll be on the full-time roster next year.\n\nAs for biggest disappointment, you could name any of the players the Oilers\ndumped for lousy production this year (Nicholls, Gilchrist, Tikkanen) or\neven Shayne Corson, but Mellanby isn't far off.\n\n-- \nAndrew Scott                    | andrew@idacom.hp.com\nHP IDACOM Telecom Division      | (403) 462-0666 ext. 253\n\nDuring the Roman Era, 28 was considered old...\n\n###\n\n","completion":" hockey"}

Richmond or Syracuse?  He was taken\nby the Jays in the Rule V draft, but not kept on the roster.  Baseball Weekly\nsaid that he was demoted to Syracuse, but a Toronto paper indicated that\nthe Braves took him back.
