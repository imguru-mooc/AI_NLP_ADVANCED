Sci., Urbana, IL\nLines: 117\n\nDisclaimer -- This is for fun.\n\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\n\"stolen hits\", defined as a play made that \"an average fielder would not\nmake with average effort.\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats\nfor the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Kurt\nStillwell would not have made.\"\n\nOK, I realize that's unfair.  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff,\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we\nreplaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% out\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\n\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Double\nPlays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).\n\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\nDCON :->.

{"prompt":"From: nlu@Xenon.Stanford.EDU (Nelson Lu)\nSubject: SHARKS REVIEW Part 3: Defensemen (21-45)\nOrganization: Computer Science Department, Stanford University.\nLines: 85\n\n#21\tPETER AHOLA\t\tSeason: 2nd\nAcquired:\t'92-93, trade with Pittsburgh for future considerations\nGrade:\t\tI (B)\n\nIt is way too early to tell about Ahola, who was acquired probably because the\nPenguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft.  Ahola had\nonly played 50 games this season (I think it's actually less; the San Jose\nMercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he\nhas played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn't been\nspectacular, and his offense isn't anything to write home about (8 points);\nit's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn\nout to be ... Peter Ahola.\n\n#24\tDOUG WILSON\t\tSeason: 16th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and\n\t\t2nd round pick in '92 entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (B)\n\nI have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high\nexpectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out.\nNevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and\nplaymaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which,\nunfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to\ncatch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for\n2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be\nWilson's last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.\n\n#29\tDEAN KOLSTAD\t\tSeason:\t2nd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (C-\/D+)\n\nIt's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of\ngames (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he's\nquickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games,\nhe did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of\nthe first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with\nthe Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward\nwith his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in\nhis level of performance to have any chance of making the team.\n\n#38\tPAT MACLEOD\t\tSeason: 2nd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nMacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my\nmemory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to\nuse him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that\nhe wouldn't clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with\nKansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment,\na \"rehab assignment\" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs.\nSince he has played so little, I can't even give a tentative grade on him, but\nhe demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive\nskills.\n\n#41\tTOM PEDERSON\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (B+)\n\nCalled up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated\nby injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours\ntruly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in\n43 games.  However, his size (5' 9\", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after\nhe began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically,\non both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach.\nBut to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance\non surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.\n\n#45\tCLAUDIO SCREMIN\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (D+\/D)\n\nHe played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly\numimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a\nsmall sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is\nquickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or\ndefense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that\nwill go down in Scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he\nwas once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.\n\n===============================================================================\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

{"prompt":"From: hbrooks@uiatma.atmos.uiuc.edu (Harold_Brooks)\nSubject: RBI, RISP, and SLG\nOrganization: Bill's Safety Cab and Record Bar, Chickasha, OK\nLines: 49\n\nOff and on over the last several months, threads about RBIs and\nrelated topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can \npredict a player's RBIs using information about his overall\nperformance and the number of runners in scoring position (RISP)\nthat he bats with.  In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated\npredicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This \ncompletely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2 \ncould do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I'd\ntake that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to\nthe data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.\n\nI've started with team data, using data from the Elias's that\nI've picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and\nb) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits.\nThat gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I don't \nhave team RBIs for '87 or I could add that year.)  If you\nrun a simple least squares fit to the data you get \n\n(RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.\n\nThe correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is\nsignificant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like the\nfit is good at the team level.  I've no started to move on to \nthe player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark,\nOzzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to \nadd quite a few more during my copious free time this year.\n\nIt doesn't do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the\nlow HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or it\ncould just be Ozzie.

They are too small.  The key to any Leafs success\nwill have to be Clark.  He is the only centre who can have\nany presence within 3-stick lengths of the slot.  Where the\nhell is Anderson?  Anderson can (in days past) get under peoples\nskin.  Put a little more bluntly, Anderson has to be an asshole.\nHe used to be good at it.  We need him now.  \n\nPerhaps, perhaps the Leafs can shut down Detroit's second line.\nI was dissappointed to see Shepard and Yserbeart flying last night.\nThese guys are the \"swing\" players for the Wings.  Last year they\ndid a major choke in the playoffs and were to blame for the quick\nexit of the Wings.  **THis has to happen again**.   Clark-Anderson-Gilmour\nshould be able to out hustle this line.  Anderson should do a\nnasty on Yserbeart.

However,\n\t\tif the Detroit coaching would be dumb enough to play their\n\t\tchecking line against these \"finesse\" players - well then\n\t\tlet them play.\n\n** Potvin can not be faulted on 5 of the goals - keep him in.\n** Van Hellamond can not be faulted for the Leafs demise either.\n** The Wings defense shut down the Leafs (especially in the slot).\n\nI hope Pat Burns realizes that his team was out-hit, out-skated, and\nout-coached on Monday night.

Here's a very simele question to which\nI'm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please\nanswer yes or no, Roger:\n Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs?\nAL only, please.\n\nFor anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact\nthat a team's win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the\nteam scores and the number the team allows. It's not a definite,\nhard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a\nrule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,\nfor every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.\nSo, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that\nthey scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other\nthings being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack\nMorris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238\nfor Boston), the \"Red Jays\" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or\nenough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn't take into account that Viola\npitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in\n(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you\nreally do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs\nhis team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this\nanalysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would\nnecessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but\nthat is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and\nevaluate Viola's as better than Morris' in the sense that \"had Morris\nperformed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.\"\n\n>It takes an open mind to really truly understand what is happening out\n>here in the real world guys.\n\nThis is true, but not so open that your brain falls out.\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com\n\nComputer...if you don't open that exit hatch this moment I shall zap straight\noff to your major data banks and reprogram you with a very large ax.

At the  4 PM Saturday\nafternoon press conference held at the new Mullins Center Arena - former\nBoston College Asst. Coach Joe Mallen was awarded the 4 year, $85,000\/year\ncontract as Head Coach for the UMass Minutemen. \n\nMallen was the third viable pick for the position, right behind Jeff Jackson\n(Lake Superior) and second behind Shawn Walsh (UMaine). Previous offers for \nthe position were rumored to have been offered to the asst. coaches of\nBrown, RPI and the head coach of the AHL Springfield Indians.\n\nUMass hockey was disbanded in 1979 due to financial constraints that had\nundermined the team's position over a period of years. In late November\nof last year, the $52 million Mullins Sports Center was opened following\nits one year construction deadline. \n\nThe Minutemen are slated to play an independent Div II\/Div III schedule this\nupcoming winter before officially entering Hockey East for the Winter 1994\nseason. Mallen has yet to comment on player recruitment strategies or\npotential team candidates for the Minutemen - it is expected that he will\nleverage off his inside contacts within New England, the Bay State and\nEurope to draw on competitive, top ice players for the University.\n\nUMass has slated 18 hockey scholarships for the upcoming Fall semester ; \nexpect to hear more from me as I hear more from my sources.\n\n....

After the Hall of Fame takes in them, it can take in\n|> Eddie\n|> \n|> Murray and Jeff Reardon.\n\nI am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling\nor perceptions and I can not without having stats to back up my points.\nHowever, I think you approached this the wrong way. I believe all of the\npeople mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I\nfeel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to\ngo but that they would deserve it more. \n\nIMHO \nDave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he\ncould hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not\nthink he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the\ngame. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I\nstill would not back him for the Hall of Fame.\n\nDave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several\nseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are\n(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a\nbit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other\npeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial\ncontributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are\nsome of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he\nwas with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to\nand while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I\nthink it deserves some consideration.\n\nLee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would\ndeserve to go before the likes of Kingman.\n\nDarrell Evans - No.\n\nEddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although\na silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not\nsure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both\nthe average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just\nthink, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.\n\nJeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the\ntop of my head I would take Lee Smith first.\n\n|> \n|>      Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody\n|> giving\n|> \n|> Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards,\n|> marginal.\n|> \n|> Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there. They're both\n|> \n|> shortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal.\n|> \n\nWell, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I\ntalked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been\ninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very\ngood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers\noffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for\nevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have\nshattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved\ngames? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a\ngame? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more\nthan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).\nBoth of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does\nGeorge Brett who also belongs in this class of player.\n\n|>      Let's be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors\n|> so\n|> \n|> liberally. Save them for the guys who really deserve it. Face it, if\n|> something\n|> \n|> isn't done, there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore.

Gee, can these guys even compare to\n|> \n|> the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?\n|> \n\nSteve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone\nmaking a case for him. \n\nJack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might\nbring up his name.\n\nKirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still\nhas time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my\nprobably will turn into a definately.\n\nNolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him\nhaving some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not\nhear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the\ncontributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would\nnot say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even\ntop 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame\nbecause of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers -\neven with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL\nthe possible votes.\n\nSo in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do\nbut I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least\nnot without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.\n\nYes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and Ryan\nMaybe - Murray and L.

Guy didn't hit a lick, had\nnegligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield,\nnow entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent\nhitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime,\nhe had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don't \nknow where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are\nsimilar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field,\nhe ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his\nOBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important)\nwas a absolute-primo-dick.  \n\tEddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's.  I know that\nMVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the\nMVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media.  \n\tLee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close.  He's had a s\nsolid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks \n(Wrigley, Fenway...).  I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been \na while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.  \n\tYou do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers,\nsimply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you \nblow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month)\nAtlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, \nthe Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should \nHomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.\n\tDarrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like\nTed Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er.\n\n>     Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody\n>giving Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards,\n>marginal.\n\n\tLemme ask you this.

His defense was SO good that he's won something along\nthe lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a \ngood argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's more\nrecent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early\n80's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie's\noffense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his\ncareer, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against Tom Niedenfuer\n:-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.\n\tYount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real\nstiff.  His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory,\nand probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as\nSS numbers go.  He's a clear HOF'er, IMHO.\n\n>isn't done, there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore. When \n>certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential \n>candidates, the absurdity is apparent. Gee, can these guys even compare to\n>the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?\n\n\tWell, as far as Garvey goes, you're right.  Garvey is a \"mediot\" \ncandidate, pushed because of his \"winning attitude\" (a minor factor, if one\nat all), and his \"great defense\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of\na tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF.\n\tSkyJack?  I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last\nyear or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk\nabout Morris' \"ability to win\" which is nothing more than Morris' \"ability\nto pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs\".  At this point, Morris is an\naverage pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned \nclose to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the\n80's for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year\nfor Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but\nnot favorites.  Morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF\n\"consideration\".  \n\tRyan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will\nthrow back your earlier logic about \"Yount and Smith being shortstops who \nhung around a long time\".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he's \njust pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre...\n(Of course, Nolan's a HOF'er...)\n\tPuck?  Probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a few\nmore years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the HOF, most\nlikely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much\nregardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY \ntragic or sudden).  He's very popular in the media and with fans, and\nlegitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined the\nleague.  I've always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the\nend, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it's too early to sell.\n\n\tThis debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it \nor not, I never tire of it.  It's an interesting subject.  Here's an off\nthe top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team.  I probably\nleft a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.

Sci., Urbana, IL\nLines: 95\n\nHaving run completely out of time, I've got to get my prophesies and\npredictions for the A.L. out.  Qualifications -- one of the worse\nfinishes in last year's prediction contest.\n\nAL East -- 1993\n\n1.  Baltimore Orioles\nWhy the Orioles?  Well, I pondered long and hard, and it all came down to\nthis:\n  -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction.\n  -- Can't bring myself to pick the Yankees\n  -- Milwaukee was a fluke\n  -- Indians aren't ready to contend\n  -- Red Sox were bad last year, and didn't get any better\n  -- Detroit's pitching will be the new definition of \"replacement level\"\n\"But you don't really think the Orioles will win, do you.\"  No.  As a matter\nof fact, I can't see any team in the American League winning either division\non paper (with the possible exception of the Yankees, who I hate).  But some-\nbody has to win, so I pick the Orioles.  \"You don't really think that Brady\nAnderson is going to repeat, do you?\"  No.  I'm basing the Orioles prediction\non the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis.  \"Glenn\nDavis?  That's insane\".  Yes.  So, without further ado:\nSTRONG POINTS:  Hoiles, Ripken some years, Olson, getting rid of Billy Ripken.\nWEAK POINTS:  Segui may start.  Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be\n  the fifth starter.  Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup.\n  (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize\n  the effect of a slumping Ripken?  If you can't move Ripken out of the #3\n  spot, why not move the rest of the line up?)\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year.\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  In a tight pennant race, team trades for Pecota.\nObPrediction:  \"The Streak\" continues.  Harold Reynolds leads the team in\n  caught stealing.\n\n2. New York Yankees.\nSTRONG POINTS:  Abbot, Key, Perez.  Could have best pitching in American\n  League.  Boggs should improve on Hayes.\nWEAK POINTS:  Mattingly still considered best hitter.  The Steinbrenner \n  factor.  (The Yankees lost to the Mets.  Can wholesale changes be far\n  behind?)  Never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. Wickman & Millitello) to\n  win a division.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Boggs hits over .300\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Howe gets arrested again.\nObPrediction:  Mattingly won't top a 700 OPS.\n\n3.  Toronto Blue Jays\nSTRONG POINTS:  Management willing to make big deals.  Management has eerie\n  power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects.  Olerud.\n  Guzman.  Alomar.\nWEAK POINTS:  The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick.\n  Losing Stewart may hurt rotation (that's *really* a bad sign).  No one in\n  the outfield can get on base.  Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Club makes no major deals in August.\nObPrediction:  Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year.  And\n  have a losing record.\n\n4.  Milwaukee Brewers\nSTRONG POINTS:  Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year.\nWEAK POINTS:  Molitor gone.  Surhoff at third?  Why?  Eldred can't keep it up.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Listach and Eldred play like last year.\nWOULD BE BAD SIGN:  Bones plays like last year.\nObPrediction:  Surhoff won't finish the year at third.\n\n5.  Cleveland Indians\nSTRONG POINTS:  Baerga, Belle, Nagy\nWEAK POINTS:  Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts.  Starts Felix\n  Fermin.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Bielecki's ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts.\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Ted Power -- bullpen ace.\nObPrediction:  Alomar will be back on the DL by the all-star break.\n\n6.  Boston Red Sox\nSTRONG POINTS:  Clemens, Viola, Clemens, Detroit, Clemens\nWEAK POINTS:  Most incompetent GM in baseball.  Key free agent signing -- Andre\n  Dawson.  Burks is gone -- Hatcher in center.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Rainouts in between Clemens starts.\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Clemens on the DL\nObPrediction:  Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon.  Interpret that how\n  you will :->\n\n7.  Detroit Tigers\nSTRONG POINTS:  Tettleton, Phillips, Whitaker\nWEAK POINTS:  If Fielder keeps declining, he'll be a shortstop this year.\n  Worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced -- but not necessarily better.\n  This year could be *very* ugly.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder deserving the MVP.\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder not whining about deserving an MVP.\nObPrediction:  Cecil *won't* lead the league in RBIs.\n\nOne more division to go....\n-- \nDale J.

He works\nhard, for sure, but is no better than average on defense, and is prone to\ncostly penalties and defensive lapses at times, while being basically an\noffensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games).  He would be hardpressed\nto make the team next year.\n\n#3\tDAVID WILLIAMS\t\tSeason: 2nd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, free agent from New Jersey\nGrade:\t\tC\/C-\n\nIMO, Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in '91-92,\nplaying a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) and\ngood defense.  But he, playing the first part of this season in Kansas City,\nwas good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that\n'91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season, he\nwas prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate the\nplaymaking skills that made him the team's leading scorer among defensemen last\nyear.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.\n\n#4\tJAYSON MORE\t\tSeason: 2nd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Montreal in expansion draft\nGrade:\t\tB+\n\nAfter being touted as the team's top defensive prospects in training camp\nbefore '91-92, More had a rather disappointing '91-92, as he was not\nparticularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He, then,\nproceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team's most\nreliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to play\nsteady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash.\nOffensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73\ngames), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as the\ndefensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.\n\n#5\tNEIL WILKINSON\t\tSeason: 4th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tB-\n\nWilkinson was probably the team's top defensive defenseman in '91-92.  However,\npartially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25\ngames total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowed\neven when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners;\nthat is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and if\nhe can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.\n\n#6\tSANDIS OZOLINSH\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (A)\n\nAt the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers),\nOzolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the team's MVP.  A serious knee injury\nin that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games),\nbut he still finished as the team's top scorer among defensemen (23 points),\nwhich, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from\ntheir defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinsh's abilities.  At the time, he\nwas playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still\nsusceptible to so-called \"rookie mistakes,\" but was probably the defenseman who\nmade the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.  If he can come back\nfrom his injuries, he is ready to be a star.\n\n#19\tDOUG ZMOLEK\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tB\n\nZmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two Sharks\nto play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense, but\nafter being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn't show it (15 points).\nHe was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the\nteam; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough\nphysical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.  But to\nbecome a fixture in this league, he needs to improve both offensively and\ndefensively, and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents.\n\n===============================================================================\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

This statement is supported based\non the increased number of 'Brave Woofers' out on the net.  A true fan of a \nteam, any team, will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean\nyears, and be amply rewarded when the time is right.  \n\nYeah, so what if Buckner let a roller go through his legs in `86.  Who cares if\nClemens told Cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower.  The\nfact is, they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fans\nsupported them.  Now that it appears that they are on lean times, the number of \ndetracters come from all over.  So what!  Let them play and we will see what \nhappens come September.  The Red Sox may not be that good, but they are certainly \nnot that bad, either and they do have a chance to win the World Series, after all,\nremember the `69 Mets?  Who would have given them a chance to even make it that\nfar, let alone beat Baltimore.\n\nLet's face it, Baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than Football\nand Basketball.

ESPN had\nprior contracts to baseball to show Monday night games and had\ncontracted all the other bs shows well in advance.  The NHL TV deal\nwas very late in the scheduling process (you normally have to do this\none-plus year out.  The NHL package was finished two weeks before the\nseason started).  ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL by\nsqueezing in extra telecasts when it could (like the last Minnesota\ngame) and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseball\ntelecasts (which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last\nnight).\n\nBut the bottom line is that ESPN cannot break contracts at will.  They\nmust honor the previous deals they made.  $$$$ _does_ have something\nto do with it, especially if you risk a $$$$$$$$ lawsuit for breach of\ncontract with baseball.\n\nSo relax.  I'm happy.

Most of the Flames neglected\nto show up, especially in their own zone, as the Kings hit at least\nfive posts! The Flames best line was probably\nSkrudland-Paslawski-Berube (which tells how bad the Flames were). Gary\nSuter scored a great goal (in fact all three Flame goals were scored\nby D-men - Yawney and Dahlquist getting the others), but also made\nsome bonehead plays. For the Kings, Pat Conacher was especially\nimpressive. \n\nThe games was VERY chippy, as Dan Mirouelli lost control early and\nnever recovered it; there were high-sticks, cross-checks, punches,\nhits from behind. Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out Warren\nRychel from behind. Flames dominated the game physically, but failed\nto take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (I don't think\nVernon can be blamed for any of the goals). Calgary went with 7 D-men,\nas Roger Johansson played LW; he looked lost IMHO - I hope King\ninserts Chris Lindbergh, Paul Kruse, or Sergei Makarov for Wednesday's\ngame. Gretzky left the game in the 2nd period with a charley-horse; no\nidea how serious - he didn't return.\n\nI still think the Flames should win this series, but they better\nbuckle down.\n\n- Vlad the Impaler\n\n###\n\n","completion":" hockey"}

There are two big problems:\n\n\t1)Total emphasis on the home teams, especially the Eagles. Unlike\n\t  the FAN hosts, who can at least answer a question about an\n\t  out-of-town team if a caller asks, the WIP hosts seem\n \t  to have no clue about any team that doesn't play on\n\t  Broad Street. Also, FANs periodic sports updates (every 20\n\t  minutes) gives sports news and scores from around the\n\t  country. It's very rare to hear an out-of-town score\n\t  being reported on WIP.\n\n\t2)The hosts. With the exception of Jody MacDonald, who I miss\n\t  from his days at FAN, none of the hosts really seems to have\n\t  both a broad knowledge of the sport or a good on-air presence.\n\t  The worst is Gary Cobb, who seems to have been hired solely\n\t  on the basis that he used to play for the Eagles.\n\nAnyway, that's my two cents on the whole FAN vs WIP battle.\n\n-Alan\n\n###\n\n","completion":" baseball"}

One\n  players' wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could\n  not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in Montreal.\n\nAnybody knows what happened when all these US football players moved\nto London, Spain, etc .. for the one year of that new football league\n(2 years ago?)\n\nI wonder what the players association thinks about going to Europe.\n\nMyself I would like to see some European teams, but what would be \nthe best way to do it? \n\nMarc\n\n###\n\n","completion":" hockey"}

The way they were used at\nthat time may have made the problem worse, although Bunning had one\nof his sharpest games of the year in the final day 10-0 shutout of\nthe Reds that cost the Reds a share of the pennant. Bunning pitched\na complete game six-hitter, striking out five and walking one. It\nwould be inetersting to see, though, how the total innings for the\nyear for Bunning and Short stacks up against the rest of the league.\nAlso notice that the Phillies played every day from at least September 1\nthrough October 1; while they didn't play substantially more games than\nthe other teams, the other teams each had a couple days off during that\nstretch.\n\n-----\nEric Smith\nerics@netcom.com\nerics@infoserv.com\nCI$: 70262,3610\n\n###\n\n","completion":" baseball"}

{"prompt":"From: farenebt@craft.camp.clarkson.edu (Droopy)\nSubject: AHL Season in review (off ice stuff)\nOrganization: Clarkson University\nLines: 114\nNntp-Posting-Host: craft.clarkson.edu\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]\n\nHere is a review of some of the off-ice things that have\naffected the AHL this year.\n\n\nST JOHN'S MAPLE LEAFS PROBLEMS\nThe St John's Maple Leafs sophomore season has been plagued by\nproblems. On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but\noff ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the\nleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of\nthe seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played \"home\" games in places\nlike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff \"home\"\ngames will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One\ndemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs' bus and\nrocked it and broke windows in the St John's Memorial Stadium.\nDespite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs\nwill return to St John's once the strike ends.\n===================================================\nSENATORS SOLD\nThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to\nthe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian\nNHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear\nthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic\nProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL\nhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting\nin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it \nclear the league was more interested in the stability of the \nAHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining\nthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. \n\nThe Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown\nNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.\n==================================================\nDALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON\nAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation out\nof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. \n\nThe Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing\ntheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they\nwanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.\n\nEnter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining\n6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks\nin the New Brunswick city.\n\nThe deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if\nthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold\n1400 for this year.\n============================================================\nSAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL\nThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of\nSaint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200\nExhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion\nfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.\n=========================================================\nCAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE\nDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore\nSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,\nannounced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.\nThere was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced\na limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players\nincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited\nfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.\n======================================================\nAHL GAME OF THE WEEK\nIn early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, produced\nby, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the Canadian\nMaritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games of\nthe week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, there\nhas been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered and\nshown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, Atlantic\nSports Network in Canada (but I'm not sure about that). I am not\nsure if playoff games will be covered.\n=====================================================\nUTICA GONE? SYRACUSE ADDED?\nThere were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around next\nseason. There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern\ncity and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them.\n=====================================================\nWHAT THE AHL MIGHT LOOK LIKE NEXT YEAR\n\nONE OPTION\t\t\t\tANOTHER OPTION\n\t\t\t\nNorthern Division\t\t\tSouthern Division\nADIRONDACK RED WINGS\t\t\tADIRONDACK\nSPRINGFIELD INDIANS\t\t\tSPRINGFIELD\nPROVIDENCE BRUINS\t\t\tPROVIDENCE\nCD ISLANDERS\t\t\t\tCDI\nPORTLAND PIRATES\t\t\tHERSHEY\n\t\t\t\t\tBINGHAMTON\nSouthern Division\t\t\tROCHESTER\nHERSHEY BEARS\t\t\t\tHAMILTON\nBINGHAMTON RANGERS\t\t\tUTICA\nROCHESTER AMERICANS\nHAMILTON CANUCKS\t\t\tAtlantic Division\nUTICA (?)

Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla,\non the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time.\n If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a\ndifferent story.  Furthermore, he is merely an athlete.  He doesn't have to\nhire anyone as Schott had to do.  Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who is\nan admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets\ngame at Shea.  He, like you, thinks that Bonilla should be suspended from\nbaseball.  Pallone is hoping for a year's suspension.  In my opinion,\nthat's downright ludicrous.  As Howie Rose on WFAN said, if you start\nsuspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time\nunder whatever conditions, then you'd probably have enough people remaining\nto play a three-on-three game.

That was the bronze medal game in the \nSM-liiga which Tichonov's team Porin Assat (the Aces of town Pori:)\nlost.  Vasili, the son of Victor Tichonov (the famous Soviet coach),\nsaid that for a long time the Sharks have been persuading him to\ntake the assistant coach post. But he wants to be the head coach where\never he goes. He definitely won't be coaching Assat anymore (after\nthree? seasons). I don't know why.\n\nVasili is a good coach I believe. Assat was a good team, produced many\nplayers to our national team. Assat wasn't a skilled team (IMHO) but\nthey had the fighting spirit. After all, they butchered Jokerit in the\nplayoffs and gave hard time to TPS, the champs. But Assat wasn't\nconsistent, only when they were in the right mood they could beat any\nteam in the SM-liiga.\n\nI am not 100% sure about the deal with the Sharks. As I said, he wants\nto be the head coach. But he and the Sharks are going to negotiate and\ndecide during the WC. I doubt that he will be the head coach but\nmaybe they'll do some compromise.\n\nCould somebody post more information about Vasili?

While you are probably correct that 400%\ndoes not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would\nrather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in\neach of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning\nby .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious\npositive association between John's statistic and winning games.  Thus,\nbefore you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must\ngo into what sort of relationship there is.\n\n>Consider an example:  Bob hits a 2-out solo HR in the bottom of the first;\n>about .12 on your scale.  He does the same thing again in the fourth, with\n>the score tied, for another .14.  And again, in the seventh, with the score\n>tied, for another .22.

Say\n>they all came on solo HR by Fred; then Fred was hitting HR to tie up the game,\n>which are just as valuable as HR to take the lead (see Lindsey), and Fred will\n>himself have accrued a good .4 rating or so.  So Fred and Bob combined have\n>amassed 138% of a win IN ONE GAME.  There's clearly a problem here.\n\nThe only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly\nhow many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many\nseasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players\nperformance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a\nplayer who gets an out gets a \"negative probability\" in most cases.\nThus, I'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers\nfor a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes,\nthey will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also,\nthe pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given\nthem a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that\npulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.  \n\n\n\n>>Greg thinking about the right things, but his intuition is off the\n>>mark.  Closers are enormously important.  The total number of runs\n>>value is outweighed by when they come, or are prevented from comming.\n>>The doubling which Greg allows is not enough.\n>\n>In another article, I proposed a test of this.  We can predict a team's \n>won\/lost record quite accurately by looking at how many runs *total* they\n>score and allow, without regard to when those runs score in the game.  If\n>late runs are really more important than early runs, then looking only at\n>late runs should lead to a *better* predictor, right?\n\nNo, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would\nthink however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning\nwould be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score \nin the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually\ncomes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue\nthat any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance\nto those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs\noften means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter\nwho gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The\noffence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not\nsaying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If\nI am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many\nruns my pitcher gives up in the ninth.       \n\n>Here's another thought experiment: apply this method to basketball.  What\n>you find is that points scored in the first *half* of the game have almost\n>exactly no value, because no lead is safe with an entire half yet to play.\n>Furthermore, the sub in off the bench who sinks the winning free throws with\n>no time on the clock gets a +1.0 for the game, while the star forward who \n>scored 27 points in the first half before spraining his ankle gets a zero.\n>\n>Does this make sense?\n\n\nNo, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would\nbe 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look,\nif you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high\nprobability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the\nball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,\nfouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \"negative chance\" that the team\nwould win.\n \nFrom reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those\nwho critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.\nAt first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really\ndoes not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players\nin crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance\ngoes down.  I've never seen convincing proof that this really happens.\nSo, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except\nfor a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to\nplayer performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you\ndo not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what\nthe average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for\ninstance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%\non average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.\nI bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just\nas good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.\n\nHow do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the\nexact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K's, BB's,\netc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched\nin closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more\nvaluble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better \npitcher?  They were probably about the same.\n\n                                                        Brian Smith\n\n###\n\n","completion":" baseball"}

Foul (Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your\n   body or stick). If you get 5 you are out for the game.\n\n2. Unsportsmanlike contact. (An intentional foul). This inlcludes all the\n   current flavours of roughing, fighting and boarding. If you get two you\n   are thrown out of the game, and fined.\n\n3. Technical foul. Bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. Penalty shot\n   is awarded. Two and you are thrown out of the game.\n\nBesides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penalties\nin a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one,\nuntil the end of the period. The victim gets two shots if he\/she was in\nthe act of shooting when the foul ocured.\n\nThis works well for several reasons. First, penalty shots are the most\nexciting thing in hockey, right? So, it follows that the more the better.\nNext, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network can\ntake a commercial. Finally, with only three penalties, the network\nannouncers (Don Meredith, Dick Vitale, John Madden, Pat Summerall, and\nMarv Levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before\nthe PA announcer says it.\n\nOh, one other rule. When a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the play\ncannot resume until the PA announcer announces it. This way, the network\ncan sneak in a few more commercials. Then, once the PA announcer has told\nthem who scored, the TV announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a \nchance of pronouncing his name right.\n\nSeriously, though, I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week,\nfor the first time in my life. I was amazed how boring it was. The play is\nso slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shooting\ncontests DURING THE PERIOD!. Of course the 'Laker Girls' get to do their \nroutines at least 6-8 times during the game, and not just between periods\neither. There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average, maybe less. The\ngame is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a\n10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours.\n\nThe reason for this has to be TV. There is plenty of room to throw in\ncommercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening.\nOn TV, basketball is fairly entertaining, IMHO. But, it is better to watch\nit on TV than to be there. If this is the road the NHL is following, then\nit truly is a sad day.\n\nEnough for now.\n\ndvb\n\n###\n\n","completion":" hockey"}

About the only tangible thing we can look at is\nopponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners.\nCatchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases. \n\n  As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big\nbat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that\nthey're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard\nplays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak \ndefensively if Blauser plays.

{"prompt":"From: accgsg@vaxa.hofstra.edu (Gary Graffagnino)\nSubject: Isles \/ Hockey Ramblings\nLines: 43\n\n\n\tWell, the Patrick Division got a little more interesting last night. \nThe Islanders lost in OT and the Devils tied the Pens.  That means if the Isles\nbeat the Devils on Friday, the will meet the Caps in the playoffs.\n\n\tHowever, I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey in\ngeneral that I need to get off my chest :).  First of all, with the Islanders \nback-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that \nthe Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period,\ncome on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable\nhow many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty \nwide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played \na golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL \ndebut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this \nguy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a \nMahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it's because the Isles don't shoot \ncorrectly.  Has anyone else noticed this?\n\n\tAlso, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick\nVukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey\ntalent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets the\npuck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties. \nRichard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he's a\ndefenseman.  He's got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus\/minus. \nThis guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such \"enforcers\"?  Not\nonly do fights slow the game down ALOT, but it takes away from the guys who are\nreally trying to play the game.  I'll be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a \ngood fight once in a while, but only when it's \"called for\".  You know, when a\nguy checks the goalie too hard.  In other words, a violation of \"hockey ethics\"\nmight cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you are\nlosing or becuase you can get away with it!! Does anyone agree that referees\nneed to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT?  I mean COME ON already. \nI'm sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase the\nreferee doesn't call it.  OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy,\nnot physical prowess.  Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost. \nIf you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to\npull a guy down to prevent it, you don't deserve to win in the first place.\n\nJust My Honest Opinion,\n\nGary at Hofstra\nACCGSG@VAXB.HOFSTRA.EDU\nACCGSG@HOFSTRA.BITNET\n\n###\n\n","completion":" hockey"}
