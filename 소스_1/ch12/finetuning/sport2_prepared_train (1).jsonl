And, of\ncourse, there will have to be new \"sub-positions\", like the power center\nwho just sits in the slot until the (blue, of course) puck comes near him,\nand the \"shooting defenseman\" and the \"point defenseman\".

Ville Siren's slap\n shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi\n scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal\n put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.\n The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo\n made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,\n during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.\n Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to\n Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered\n the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund \n skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.\n Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line\n where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since\n there was traffic in front, 4-3.\n Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan\n and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to\n Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.\n Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only\n 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone \n with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja\n made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.\n The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal\n late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,\n showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck\n and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side.\n But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the\n game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow\n angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.\n\n All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best.\n Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period\n to try no combinations.\n\n Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-\n Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.\n Stillman good on defense.\n Some players aren't good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner\n hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson\n will likely have to leave for NHL pros.\n\n Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the\n Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn't have a very good game, we've seen him\n a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC.\n I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team.

Going into the 1992\/93 season, the numbers of Euros on\nNHL teams have escalated to the following stats:\n\nCanadians: 400\nAmericans: 100\nEuropeans: 100\n\n   Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top\n25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.\n\n   Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sick\nof watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let's say, the\nRed Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like \"Bure\" \"Konstantinov\" and\n\"Borshevshky\". Is this North America or isn't it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec,\nand Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on other\nteams is getting worse as well. \n\n    I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about \"Pavel Bure, the\nRussian Rocket\" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I see\nthe Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I'm not a\nCanucks fan to begin with ;-). \n\n    Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that\nI resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (and\nsome Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR\nNORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren't even\nbetter hockey players. It's all hype.

Olson was still\nrecovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe),\nand there were questions as to whether he would be\nable to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.\n\nI was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez\ncan hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was\nthe Braves \"Defensive Catcher\" prospect, while Brian Deak was\nthe Braves \"Offensive Catcher\" prospect.  Besides, Olson\nand Berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboard\nbox, and don't walk enough to be useful.\n\nBut Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went\nwith the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down\nat the start of the season, he wouldn't have gotten his job back.\n\n2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around.\nAfter all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and\ntear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher\n(California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to\nmove Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.\nPlus, you'd have to eat that salary, which isn't huge, but isn't\ntiddleywinks either (I think Olson's at about $800,000, Berryhill\nat $450,000, but that's only what I recall).\n\n3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to\nplay in this also.  What is it, that 5\/6 of the 2+year players\naren't eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1\/6 that were on the roster\nthe longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change,\nbut the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business\nstandpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June\/the\nfirst time Olson\/Berryhill go on the DL.\n\n4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn't on the team.\nI still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves,\nand the truth is that I'd rather see our best team on the field,\nwhich, IMO, includes Lopez.\n\nOf course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won't need him. ;)\n\nAs for the Schuerholz\/Cox conversation, I imagine it went\nlike this:  (Remember, they've BOTH been GM's)\n(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)\n\nCox:  OK, we've sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a\nlittle smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding\nis better than it used to be.\n\nSchuerholz:  Well, we'll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion\njust won't sign that baseball only contract.  We can't count\non him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the\ndefense.  Besides, Gorman's not ready to give up on\nBilly Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher's gone AND Deion signs,\nwe can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to\ngive us some pitching depth in 1995.\n\nCox:  Yep, that'll be nice.  Too bad Deion won't sign.\nOK, I'll look for Nieves when Justice starts having\nBerry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about\nKlesko?\n\nSchuerholz:  Well, we've still got to fork out another 1.5 mil\nfor Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money\nor Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell,\nbut somehow he doesn't seem to be the same GM.  First\nJeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he\ngets rid of Brian Jordan, then I'd HAVE to believe that he\nand Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!\n\nCox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I'll wait til the trading\ndeadline for my Hunter\/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few\nextra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California...\nif Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid.\nAnd if that doesn't work, then perhaps Sid's knees\ncould be \"persuaded\" to act up.  There's always the\n15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!\n\nSchuerholz:  What about Caraballo?\n\nCox:  Well, he's not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts\nin Richmond, he'll start walking more.  Besides, if he's going to be\narbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually\nget some value from him before he makes the big bucks.\n\nSchuerholz:  Now, let's see.  That leaves Lopez.\n\nCox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn't think Olson\nwould recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into\nrunning into him again?\n\nSchuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he'll get\n$3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one\nextra year.  Besides, until Olson's shown his stuff a little\nbit, I can't trade him.  Besides, Berryhill's a left-handed\nhitter.  You know how rare that is?\n\nCox:  Don't you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common,\nif you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in\nthe World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!\n\nSchuerholz:  Hey, you're the one who wouldn't write Lopez\ninto the lineup.\n\nCox:  Well, you're the one who went out and got me Jeff\nReardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn't be used\nto our pitching staff's stuff.  He got some time with\nthem this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely\nwe only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?\n\nSchuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep\nwill be hurt by May.\n\nCox:  OK, OK, you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surely\none of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I\ncan call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant!\nTHE WORLD SERIES!

I found the same ratios for HR.\n\nYear  rpg   lea  ratio  hrpg lea ratio   \n1992 10.22  9.10 1.12   1.65 1.58 1.04\n1991  9.53  8.87 1.07   1.41 1.26 1.12\n1990 10.71  8.72 1.23   1.49 1.24 1.20\n1989  9.07  8.34 1.09   1.27 1.11 1.14\n1988  9.90  8.37 1.18   1.29 1.08 1.19\n1987 12.55 10.70 1.17   2.39 1.92 1.24\n1986  9.45  9.33 1.01   1.35 1.38  .98\n1985  9.50  8.54 1.11   1.53 1.34 1.14\n1984  9.99  9.10 1.10   1.55 1.59  .97\n1983 10.60  9.99 1.06   2.03 1.74 1.17\n1982 11.29 10.35 1.09   2.24 1.91 1.17\n1981 10.29  9.25 1.11   1.43 1.49  .96\n1980 10.59  9.43 1.12   1.63 1.46 1.12\n      1446\/13-->1.11     1444\/13-->1.11\n\nIt seems pretty clear that Denver will have a large effect \non runs scored (I'll stick with my prediction from last year \nthat it'll be one of the top 3 in the NL this year) \nand a fairly large effect on Homeruns - though apparently not as large as \nAtlanta, Wrigley, Cincinnati and San Diego.\nStill it ought to be a pretty decent home run park.\n\njohn rickert\nrickert@nextwork.rose-hulman.edu\n\n###\n\n","completion":" baseball"}

EDT\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It's\nan honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the\nwinner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the\nRose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell\nthat this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win\na national championship.  And we're glad to have them here.\n\n     I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to\nwin the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to\ncheer them onto victory.\n\n     Coming from a state that is also relatively small in\nsize, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can\nunderstand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears.\nIn our state people are still talking about the time we won the\nOrange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was\nback in 1978.  I'm sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine\nwill as proud of this team as they are today.\n\n     You know, in my state football is a slightly more\npopular sport than hockey.  We don't have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.)\nBut after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I\ncan understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came\nhere.  Hockey is a tough game.  It's a hard-hitting sport.  It does\nhave one virtue though, there's a penalty for delay of game.  I wish\nwe had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)\n\n     In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In\nthe United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority\nLeader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior\nSenator -- Cohen looks so young, I can't imagine.  (Laughter.)  I'm\nactually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger\nthan me.\n\n     On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done\na great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship\ngame, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I\nknow a little bit about.\n\n     Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams\nand in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and\nSenator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine\nmust feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a\nteam, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from\nbehind.\n\n     I think it's important, as I ask young people from\naround America who have achieved outstanding things in working\ntogether, to come here to the White House to be recognized and\nappreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values\nand those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all\nof our lives.\n\n     We now have another role model, and I'm glad to have\nthem here today.  (Applause.)\n\n     (The President is presented with team jersey.)\n(Applause.)\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.  I love it.  It's beautiful.\n(Applause.)\n\n     (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That's great.  (Applause.)\n\n                             * * * * * *\n\n     Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Waco\nthis morning, sir?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the Attorney\nGeneral made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions\nto her and to the FBI.\n\n     Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it\nshould be executed?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions.\nThat was their judgment, the FBI.\n\n     Q  Is this a raid?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to --\ntalk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be\ndone, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical\ndecisions.\n\n     Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this\nmorning?\n\n     Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my\nquarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).\n\n     SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator\nMitchell, he's worth a quarter any day.\n\n     Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen\nthis week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going to\nhave for the rest of the week.

And many of those\npurposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people\nback to work.  I don't want to go back and revisit every one, but you\n\n\ncan do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position\nthey're taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year\ndeficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time\nand then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got\nto be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base their\nposition.  They've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this\nkind that had very little to with putting the American people back to\nwork.

There are 30 to 50 Florida\nPanthers in the Everglades National Park, the Big Cypress National \nPreserve and other parts of southwestern Florida.\n\n\"The Panther is the quickest-striking of all cats,\" Torrey said.  \n\"Hopefully that's the way we'll play on ice.\"\n\nMore BIO:\nIn Torrey, Huizenga has the first man hired by the expansion Islanders\nin 1972 and the one most responsible for guiding the Islanders to four\nconsecutive Stanley Cup championships (their first after only eight\nseasons) and 14 consecutive winning seasons.  As executive vice president\nof the California Golden Seals, Torrey watched the Seals go to the play-\noffs in 1968, only their second NHL season.\n\n\"I guess this completes my own personal hat trick\", said Torrey, 58, a\nnative of Montreal but a resident of Bear Lakes Country Club in Palm\nBeach.\n\nJim G.\nother accounts:\ngorycki@sol.cse.fau.edu\njimg@cybernet.cse.fau.edu\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"I repeat myself when under stress.

The idea was that youngsters could\nplay almost as well, and had the potential to improve where these\nolder guys did not. \nAnd they traded Mullen, because he wanted to go, not because he\nwasn't good enough, but I think they were a bit too optimistic\nin thinking they could make up for his contributions.\nAn example from this season, Skriko was brought in on a trial basis\nbut not kept, because of his age. I thought he was a decent\ncontributor worth keeping around.\n\nThe youth movement has its advantages; look at Gaudreau who\nmight still be in KC if more veterans had been kept around.

How good does their rotation look?  The last I heard, the order is\n>Tapani, Erikson, Mahomes, Banks, and some guy I've never heard of. \n>(sounds pretty pathetic to me)\n\nWell, maybe it will be.  Banks is a 24 year-old prospect who \"hasn't \nmatured as quickly as they would have liked.  Mahomes is a 22 year-old \nwho is very highly touted.  Tapani and Erickson are also young, and \nhave looked very good this spring.  The last spot was between Jim \nDeshaies, formerly of Houston and S.D. and Mike Trombley.  Deshaies \nhasn't looked very good this spring, so I believe that the spot has \ngone to Trombley, although they hadn't wanted 3 starters this unproven. \nI personally believe very highly in Mahomes and Trombley.\n\n>\n>2.  Who is playing short and third?\n\nWell, Scott Leius is the shortstop.  He played mostly 3B last year, but \nwas a SS in the minors, and moved back after Gagne left to K.C.  3B is \nsplit (maybe) between Pagliarulo, who has had a great spring, and Terry \nJorgenson, a good looking kid who has languished in Portland for 3 \nyears.  I'm not sure how the time will be divided, but they seem to be \nhappy with what they have here.  I like Jorgenson, but I fear they \nmight give too much time to Pags.\n \n>3.  How's Winfield doing?\n\nSorry, can't help you here.\n\nDennis\n\n###\n\n","completion":" baseball"}

Hence, they did help build the league, although\nthey were not great players themselves.  \n\n\tI agree that a name is a name is a name, and if some people\nhave trouble with names that are not easily processed by the fans,\nthen changing them to names that are more easily processed seems like\na reasonable idea.  If we can get people in the (arena) door by being\nuncomplicated, then let's do so.  Once we have them, they will realize\nwhat a great game hockey is, and we can then teach them something\nabotu the history of the game.  \n \n>The history of the names can be put rather succinctly.

Conn Smythe, for example, was a classy\nindividual (from what I have heard). \n\n\tAlso, isn't the point of \"professional\" hockey to make money\nfor all those involved, which would include the players.  What I think\nyou might be saying is that the players have not made as much money as\nshould have been their due, and it is the players that are what make\nthe game great not the people who put them on the ice, so naming\ndivision after management people rather than players is adding insult\n(in the form of lesser recognition) to injury (less money than was\ndeserved).   \n\n_______________________\nEvan Pritchard --------  Number 1 or 9 depending on the hockey pool \n=======================\nepritcha@psych.uiuc.edu\n\n###\n\n","completion":" hockey"}

Sci.\nLines: 74\n\nI've noticed that is has become fashionable lately in rsb to predict\nthe Marlines to finish ahead of the Cubs....how?\n\nFirst Base:\n\nGrace vs Destrade...Could Destrade be the second coming of Cecil\nFielder? I doubt it. If Destrade performs to the height of expectations,\nthen even, otherwise, edge to Cubs\n\nSecond Base:\n\nSandberg vs Barberie...No contest. Sandberg will be back May 1. Edge\nto Cubs...a big edge.\n\nShortstop:\n\nVizcaino vs Weiss...Vizcaino is excellent defensively, but is an\nautomatic out at bat. Weiss isn't much better with the stick. Even.\n\nThird Base:\n\nDave Magadan vs Buechelle...Magadan has a higher OBP and is a better hitter.\nBuechelle has more power and is better defensively (I think) Edge to\nFlorida.\n\nCatcher: \n\nSantiago vs Wilkins...Wilkins is OK, but Santiago is better. Edge to\nMarlins\n\nLeft Field:\n\nConine vs Maldonado...Wow! 4 for 4 yesterday...I know Conine has potential.\nI watched him play at Omaha the last couple years. Until he actually proves\nhimself, I give Maldonado the edge, however, like at 1B, this is position\nwhere Florida might be even or better *if* the player there has a huge year.\n\nCenter:\n\nScott Pose vs Wilson\/May...Edge to May, even if Wilson. Hopefully the\nCubs will use may and save Wilson for pinch running and the like. May\nisn't Ken Griffey Jr, but he will hit .275 with 15 homers if he plays\nfull time.\n\nRight:\n\nFelix vs Sosa...Felix Jose has occasional power and a bad OBP. So does\nSosa, but Sosa also has speed and a good glove. Edge to Cubs\n\nStarters:\n\nAquino? Armstrong? Hammond? A lot of fifth starters here. The Cubs won't\nremind anyone of the Brave staff, but Morgan-Castillo-Guzman-Hibbard\nis average to OK...better than the Marline. Edge to Cubs\n\nMiddle Relief:\n\nEven. The Cubs have some decent middlemen, and so do the Marlins.\nCarpenter anf Klink or decent, but so are Assenmacher and McElroy.\n\nCloser:\n\nA healthy Harvey is a big edge to the Marlins. Meyers is decent, but\nno Harvey. Of course, the Cubs may have a few more games to save.\nLook for 30 saves, 5 blown from Meyers, and 25 saves, 3 blown (with\na better ERA) for Harvey. Edge Florida.\n\nOverall, an edge to Chicago.\nNeither of these teams will threaten to win anything, of course.\ne\n--\nmsilverm@nyx.cs.du.edu\t\t\t\tGO CUBS!!!\n\n\"One likes to believe in the freedom of baseball\" - Geddy Lee\n\n###\n\n","completion":" baseball"}

It turns out that the mask is\ncustom-fit to the goalie's face.  The goalie puts his\/her face through a\npiece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the face\nand forehead to show.  Hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plastic\nwrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face.

This is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involves\npadding the inside, hardening the exterior, fitting the cage, etc. etc.  \nJohn Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show. \n\n>He exhibited a couple masks he is currently working on, namely, a\n>new mask for Andy Moog which is a basic re-working of his current\n>mask with the bear on it, and new mask for Bob Essensa which was \n>*really* cool -- the Jets logo was on the chin, and there were two\n>fighter jets on either side on the forehead with an air-brushed\n>back-ground.\n\nYeah, Essensa's mask looked really good.\n \n>The best one of all was one he never talked about, he just held it up.\n>It has the current Leafs crest on the chin and an awesome looking \n>black panther on the forehead -- it *has* to be a new mask for Felix\n>Potvin, but he never said whose it was.\n\nActually, I thought I heard him say that it _was_ Potvin's for certain.

Are you saying that a kid who moves from AA to AAA\nand then does not improve would have been better off making a\ndirect leap to the majors?  If a player does well at AA and then\ndoes not improve at AAA, isn't that a sign that maybe he doesn't\nbelong in the bigs?\n\nNow, Keith Mitchell.  As I recall (no stat books handy - surprise!)\nhe jumped from AA to Atlanta in 1991.  He did so well that he was\nreturned to the minors, where he didn't do very well at all.  Now\nhis career is in jeopardy.  So how does he fit in with your \npoint.  Good MLE's in AA.  Moved him right to the big club.  Now\nhe's one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball.\nDuh.\n\n\n>That was me, and you so far your only counter-proposal is that they\n>really don't understand how good Lopez is, or overvalue experience,\n>or some combination of the two.

Sorry about that.\n\n#8\tLARRY DEPALMA\t\tSeason:\t3rd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, free agent from Minnesota\nGrade:\t\tI (C-\/D+)\n\nNo netter\/fan watching the Sharks, including me, knows where DePalma was at\nthe end of the season; the Sharks appeared to still have his rights, but he\nwasn't in San Jose, he wasn't in Kansas City, and his name hasn't appeared on\nthe waiver wire.  And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part\nfor DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning,\nDePalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good\ndefense.  Unfortunately, the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest of\nthe way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally looked\nlethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down to\nKansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated\nwhen it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from\nthe watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks\nofficials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.\n\n#10\tJOHAN GARPENLOV\t\tSeason: 3rd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round\n\t\tpick in '92 entry draft from Vancouver\nGrade:\t\tA\/A-\n\nAfter an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest\nof the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on the\nteam, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob\nGaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second in\nthe MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as he\nwas seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him\nby putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power-\nplay goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despite\nhis small size (5' 11\", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself around\nwhen necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to work\non his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and\nwas actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He will\nbe a major key to the offense next year.\n\n#15\tDAVID BRUCE\t\tSeason: 5th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nAfter a banner '91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and\nwas third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was bothered\nvirtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the\nlineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult to\nspeculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by\nthe injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man\nshort in the Sharks' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive\nleader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame,\nbecause otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his\nfuture with the Sharks next season appears clouded.\n\n#18\tMARK PEDERSON\t\tSeason:\t3rd\nAcquired:\t'92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C\/LW Dave Snuggerud\nGrade:\t\tI (B)\n\nIt is difficult for me to understand the Flyers' decision to unload Pederson,\nafter a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but\nafter riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to the\nSharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with\n41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited by\ninjuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But when\nhealthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size\n(and the willingness to throw it around, although he's not considered a\nphysical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liability\non defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how\nmuch, exactly, Pederson can do.\n\n#20\tJOHN CARTER\t\tSeason: 4th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, free agent from Boston\nGrade:\t\tI (B+\/B)\n\nCarter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard\nwork worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although he\ndid look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55\ngames) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can\ndo, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about\n20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, always\nhussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive\nzone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end,\nbut he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress\noffensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  He\nis very unlikely to be back next season.\n\n#28\tJEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (B+\/B)\n\nI don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the\n14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creating\nopportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHL\nduty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those\n14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in training\ncamp before the '91-92 season limited Quintin, the team's leading scorer in\nexhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the\nSharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be a\nsolid contender for regular duty next season.\n\n#41\tMARK BEAUFAIT\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nAfter a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the\nSharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the\nSharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only\nNHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5' 9\", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shy\nto throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times,\nalthough it's too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he played\nmostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan and\nKansas City.\n\n#42\tJAROSLAV OTEVREL\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t8th round pick in 1991 entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nLike Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was\nup for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generally\nvery much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either,\nalthough that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those\n7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once his\ndefense is acceptable, he should be ready.\n\n#44\tMICHEL PICARD\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau\nGrade:\t\tI (B-\/C+)\n\nThe 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to\nbe close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the\nSharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for\nhis only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City.\nHe was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive\nbrilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, although\nhe has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks' bait in the\nexpansion draft.\n\n#45\tDODY WOOD\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (D+\/D, although perhaps I shouldn't give a grade at all)\n\nI have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probably\nno surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although\n13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, was\nnot particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing\nmany fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games,\nprojecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He's not ready, and needs at\nleast another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, if\nnothing else.  His relatively small size (5' 11\", 181 lbs.) does not give much\npossibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.\n\n===============================================================================\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

He injured his back (a disk injury) and did one stupid thing,\nwhich was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it because\nhe knew he was on the bubble. The Sharks then sent him to K.C., at which\npoint he disclosed the injury. Since he didn't disclose it, the Sharks and\nhe disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not\nreporting. That was eventually worked out, the Sharks re-instated him as\ninjured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shipped\nhim down to K.C. He fully expects to play in the NHL again, although clearly\nnot with the Sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no, beyond just a\nno-no).\n\nVery nice guy. Always hustled his butt off. He disappeared because he was\nhurt. I expect he'll surface with another team at some point (probably\nanother expansion team), but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of\nhis career.

His future with the Sharks was made clear to me\none night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried to\nhold Joel Otto against the board. He literally had one arm around Otto's\nneck and another wrapped around Otto's stick arm. Otto casually turned\naround and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal, as though Carter\nwasn't there. Hustle can only cover size so far.\n\nThe Sharks have told me, point blank, that he's gone for good (ditto HUbie\nMcDonough). He was one of the favorites of the staff, but as one said to me\n\"you have to make room for the kids\". Carter, in fact, refused to report to\nK.C. and has been suspended by the Sharks.

Of course I can't say this\nfor sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I\ndon't think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically\nhuman attitudes.  \n\nWith the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing \nmoney by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff\n\"take\" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely\nto consistently be a force in the playoffs.

While they may love to play the \ngame that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make\na decent living. \n\nOf course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is \nbeing paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his\njob well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.\n\nThe second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions\nof the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top \nafter the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely\naccord victory to the team that has remained healthy and \"hot\".  The \nemphasis on the playoffs, with their \"sudden death\" appeal has been promoted\nby the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburgh\nloses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in the\nleague over the year.

The OT game winner came from Dimitri\nYushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS\nnever led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an\nNHL record 9th OT loss this season.\n\nRoster move:\n\nGord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill\n\nInjuries:\n\nRyan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4\/15 and was scratched.\n\nLines:\n\nEklund-Lindros-Recchi\nBeranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\nFaust-Acton-Brown\n\nGalley-Bowen\nYushkevich-Hawgood\nCarkner-Hynes\n\nDominic Roussel\n\nGame Summary:\n\nI didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts\nI didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by\na few things I did pick up:\n\nFirst Period:\n\tHartford, Nylander 10, 8:51\n\tPhiladelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp)\nPenalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda,\nHar (interference) 18:43\n\nSecond Period:\n\tHartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00\n\tPhiladelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09\n\tHartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38\nPenalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har\nmajor-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski,\nHar (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50\n\nThird Period:\n\tHartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)\n\tPhiladelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11\n\tPhiladelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38\nPenalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30\n\nOvertime:\n\tPhiladelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15.\nPenalties - None\n\nPower Play:\n\tPhiladelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4\n\nGoalies:\n\tPhiladelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)\n\tHartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)\n\nOn the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue\nline and Nylander stripped him and took off.\n\nThe Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.\n\nThe Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it\nended up behind the goalie.\n\nOn the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in.\nThis is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if\nthey get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner,\nGalley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of\nthem was the closest FLYER to the play.\n\nThat's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it\nwas that scored, much less how.\n\nFrom what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart\nasked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the\ngame. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised\nthat a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy \nSoderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1\/2 a season\nand, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.\nBut here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for\nnumber 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between\nhim and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????\n\nWhat? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...\n\n#1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.\nThe difference between the team's record with him and without him is no\naccident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without\nRecchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric\nLindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey\nnext season.\n\n#2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour,\nand Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't\nplay a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family\nhas a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy\nSoderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again\nabout being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.\n\n#3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season\nscoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player\nget as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season.\nNot a tough choice.\n\nHonorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total\nwhich he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line\nthis year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the\ndefensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.\n\nDimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie\nmistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling\nthat with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up\nanything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman\nin years to come.\n\nGarry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some\nthings you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,\nhe certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his\nwishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive\ncontribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end\nwill make him a much more important part of the team next year.\n\nBrent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.\nBut consistency became a problem for him.\n\nA couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members:\n\nTom Misnik, a member of the mailing list, would like to exchange E-mail\naddresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer.\nIf you're interested, you can send him mail at:\n\natt!ACR.ORG!TMISNIK\n\nThe FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning\npercentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in\nPatrick), 23-14-5 at home. They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in\nnext years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as\nmany goals as they allowed, 319.\n\nThe 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.\n\nI will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey\nNews that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I have\nno other way of getting them.\n\nI hope you've all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have.

Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, that\ngoaltending was the key, etc etc.  Well, the key doesn't quite fit if you're\nMontreal.  The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call, but let's face it;\nhe literally left his feet to throw an elbow.  Blaming Stewart is just an\nexcuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst\ngoals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Besides,\nStewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT.\n\nMontreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to clear\ntraffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more). \nNormally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than \nfive, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME \nESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.  But I don't\nthink this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear \nthe zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  Roy is paid big money to \nplay.

Moog looked bad on Mogilny's goal with five seconds left in the second,\nIMO.  How about Neely though?   Holy shit, what a player.\n\nSpeaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.  I haven't seen a\nteam so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of their\nzone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red \nArmy.  \n\nBut I still hate the team.\n\nOn the rest of the games:  Didn't St. Louis' winning goal come on a\npowerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly, especially against Detroit. \nSame goes for Calgary; very, very undisciplined.

He hit three 6 times.  I am almost sure about this. In\ncase anyone is wondering, the record for two homer games is held by Babe\nRuth and is 72.  Mize's record may not last for much longer because of Juan\nGonzalez.  He has at least three games with three and maybe 4.  I know that \nhe had at least two last year and one as a rookie.  I don't have any record\nbooks at college for me to check on though.  Please let me know, okay, if I \nam wrong.  \n\tOnto the Padres.  Is there anyone out there who follows them?- especial-ly those with access to local news?  I don't here anything in Los Angeles and I\ncan't get McPaper consistently around here.  \ncomment:  It looks as though San Diego has gotten the better of the two deals\nthat brought Bell and Plantier to the Padres.  It has also forced the team to use Darrell Shermann.  Of course, Plantier could get injured again or he could \nhit with the power of 91 but with a lower average.  Bell always could finish\nwith .240 and 15-18 hrs-essentially Jerald Clark's numbers.  \nleadoff comment:  Craig Shipley??????  I get on base 29% of the time if I'm \nlucky at leadoff?  Hell, of the usual starters, use Gwynn.  He's got 4 steals\nalready.  Is Shipley starting because of an injury to Stillwell, though?  I\nhaven't seen Stillwell's name in any box scores.  Anyway unless you are going\nto use Shermann at leadoff then use Gwynn.  He at lesat gets on base and this\nyear is stealing bases.\nSheffield comment:  Though the season is early and stats mean nothing.\nWitness Phillips batting .500+ currently.

The 1992 Olympic teams contained about\nas much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean\nBurke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in\nthe NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn \nMcEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been \n3rd\/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the \nKings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembled\nfrom the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford \nor Tampa Bay currently are doing.\n---\nBut what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up\nwith Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and\nno Canadian\/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia? \nHere is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:\n\n(28-30=superstar)\n(23-27=star)\n(18-22=NHL regular+)\n(13-17=NHL regular)\n( 8-12=role player)\n\nFINLAND:  \n\nD-Jyrki Lumme.......20\nD-Teppo Numminen....20\nD-Peter Ahola.......13\n\nC-Jari Kurri........25\nC-Christian Ruuttu..16\n\nR-Teemu Selanne.....27\n\nL-Esa Tikkanen......20\n(Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)\n\nSWEDEN:\nD-Ulf Samuelsson....21\nD-Fredrik Olausson..20\nD-Niklas Lidstrom...18\nD-Calle Johansson...18\nD-Kjell Samuelsson..17\nD-Tommy Sjodin......13\nD-Tommy Albelin......7\n\nC-Mats Sundin.......26\nC-Thomas Steen......18\n\nR-Thomas Sandstrom..22\nR-Ulf Dahlen........18\nR-Michael Nylander..13\n\nL-Per-Erik Eklund...18\nL-Johan Garpenlov...16\nL-Mikael Andersson..15\nL-Jan Erixon........14\n\nThis would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg's\nSelanne & Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's\nTikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But\nI have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did\nwell in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of\nMarkus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's\npresumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at\nthe highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be\nthat the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL.\n---\nSweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America.\nTheir points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 top\nplayers combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in \nSweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points.\nDeducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on\nSwedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high\nas Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \"dynasty\" talk\nisn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish\/all-Swedish team might have an\nadvantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time,\nwon't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably\nplay the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the\nNorth American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top \nScandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a \ncouple of years the same way Edmonton's \"dynasty\" crumbled in the late '80s. \nSome fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an \nexclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a \ncompromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during \nthe first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this, \nthe amateur draft should be open to anyone. \n\n> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>  J O O   J O O   J O K E R I T  !  !  !

Very few fans real-\nistically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet they\nstill go out to see Gretzky.  This is the marketing strategy - selling the\ngame by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, the\nNBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman\/McNall leadership is \nbringing to the league.  They have gone on record as stating that they are\ntrying to sell the game on its stars.  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect \nexamples of players that real fans know aren't worth a damn and yet, being\nbenificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totals\nthat would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants to\nattract, that these players are indeed superstars.\n\n>>They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario, that is \n>>true.

He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has \n36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captain\nthroughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos and\nMark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than\nMVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player on\nthe team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guess\nI place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.\n\nBiggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last season\nas a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+\npoints. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all coming\nfrom the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: Andrew\nCassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, and\nPetrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23\nand will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the\nrole of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake\nbounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put\nup about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, started\nperforming better offensively once he was converted from center to wing, \nalthough lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the\nright side.\n\nBiggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77\npoint season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started\nthe season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate,\nsince he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it).\nCullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded\nthe powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked his\nway out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years left\nto run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the \nMaple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subpar\nafter signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes of\ncompetence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much better\nhockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who only\nseemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got\nto make a number of starts in a row.\n\n-SG (a real live Hartford Whalers season ticket holder)\n-steveg@cadkey.com\n\n###\n\n","completion":" hockey"}

{"prompt":"From: pcaster@mizar.usc.edu (Dodger)\nSubject: Gross Grosses Out Dodger Fans AGAIN.\nOrganization: University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA\nLines: 60\nNNTP-Posting-Host: mizar.usc.edu\n\nWent to the Dodgers game tonight -- it was cap night.\n \nAstacio pitched ok, but had control trouble all night.\nIn the first, he walked a batter, balked him to second, then\na single scored the run, with the batter taking second on the\nthrow home.  Another single made the score 2-0 Cards.\n \nLasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler, Reed, And Piazza\nbatting third!  Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder\nand Webster.\n \nPiazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards.\nThe Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single\nby Offerman.\n \nBy the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, but\nthe score was still 2-2.  The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive\nplays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner\ntrying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who\nhad strayed a bit from first base, etc.\n \nKarros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into\nthe outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going\nthrough, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threw\nto third and EASILY got the runner at third.\n \nMy heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen.\n \nAstacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the game\nwith the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over.\n \nGross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1\/3\ninnings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inning\ngame had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was fresh\ngiven his light work out Tuesday.\n \nGross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hit\nto the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resulted\nin a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it\n3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next\nthing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner on\nfirst was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had\nscored long before that.\n \nMeanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning.\nLee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karros\nand Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?).\nCory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, but\nthat was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got his\nthird straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my\nfree Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps this\nup all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year\nhonors.  Though its really early, Karros is already showing signs\nof a sophomore jinx year.\n \nThe final score...Cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits.\nDodgers 2 runs on 7 hits.\n \nDodger\n\n###\n\n","completion":" baseball"}

Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**.\nOf course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you\nget them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're a\ncoach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you\nhave got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto\ngame, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in\nthat game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same\nfor Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a\ngreat play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If\nyou were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.\n\nBut if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie\nstand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel\ndoesn't have a game like that in him.\n\n> Well if you look back to November when Roussel was the #1 goalie (Soderstrom\n> was being treated for his heart ailment).

FLYERS management never says bad thing about\nRoussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either.

It was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win Monday and five in\nthe 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday. Jamie Navarro pitched\nseven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part\nin the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado has\npitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next lowest\non the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!\n\nIt doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, while\nThon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The next\nbest hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at\n.238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team\nis 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs\/game\nand giving up 6.6\/game. \n\nStill, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should\ncome around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave\nthe Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo, \nFetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be\nsuccessful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either\nheld small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay,\nthe defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen\nis a big question mark.\n\nIn other news, Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday, while William\nSuero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal.

Well, I BEG to differ....\n\nIMHO, Clark deserved to be a first star as much as Gilmour did. His\nfast breaks towards the net and the good opportunites that he\ncreated reminded me of the Clark of old. (But not to take any of the\ncredit away from Gilmour).\n\nI think the Leafs are playing GREAT hockey. WHY? \nWell first look at their injury list which includes, Cullen, Ellet,\nZezel, Macoun. Of course my question is this....how will the Leafs\nfare when they are once again \"healthy\" if they are playing this well\nso far??\n\nSecond, just look at their standings, still second in defence,\nmoved from 11th overall to 6th over in the last month, haven't lost\nat home in last 12 games, 8 game undefeated streak..etc.\n(BTW, am I wrong or was this Potvin's first shut-out? I can't \nremember him having any as of yet.)\n\nWell, as of April 3 we see that the race for first in the Norris\nhas truly begun and it will be a VERY CLOSE race between Chicago and\nToronto. And the best game of the season will probably be their last\nagainst each other. (is anyone lucky enough to have tickets to\nsee this one?)\n\nComing to the stretch and still a ROAR'IN!!!!!\nGo LEAFS Go!!!!\n-- \n****************************************** \n*  Alfred (Yong-Jeh) Yim                 *   Toronto wins the  \n*  4B Mathematics (Actuarial Science)    *     (   ?    )    CUP.\n*  University of Waterloo, Canada.       *  i like \"coca-cola\" idea personally\n*  E-mail: ayim@descartes.waterloo.edu   *  \n*****************************************************************************\n\n###\n\n","completion":" hockey"}

Seems only the SDCNs realize how much baseball is\na *team* game, combining efforts from every player for the win.\n\nConsider the Red Sox game last night.  The Sox won 4-3 in the bottom\nof the 13th.  Who won the game?\n\n-Clemens pitched a strong nine (?) innings, allowing only two runs.\n-Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings, though he needed some excellent\n defensive plays behind him to do so.\n-Quantrill pitched a couple of innings, gave up the go-ahead run, and\n got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of\n the inning.\n\nLooks like a team effort to me!  Yet only Quantrill got credit for\nthe win.\n\nHow about the offense?\n-Dawson and Vaughn hit (I think) HRs early in the game.  Without either\n one, the Sox would have lost in nine.\n-Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single.\n-Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana, providing the speed to go from first\n to third when...\n-Cooper ripped a *second* single in the inning.\n-Melvin avoided the DP, getting the run home with a sac fly.  Not much of\n a help, but it was something.\n-Scrub Richardson then hit a double, scoring the speedy Cooper all the\n way from first!  (Hill's lack of defense helped.)\n\nCooper and Zupcic were credited with runs, Melvin and Richardson were\ncredited with RBIs.  But it seems to me that it was Quintana's hit\nthat set up the whole inning!  And did Melvin really contribute as\nmuch as Richardson?\n\nFurthermore, people seem to consider RBIs to be more significant than\nruns.  Did Melvin contribute more than Cooper?  Cooper provided the\ngame-winning baserunner, and moved the tying run to third base with\nonly one out!\n\nAssigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous.  You\ncan argue that OBP and SLG don't show you who came through in the\nclutch, but R&RBI don't do any better.  At least OBP and SLG don't\n*claim* to try to tell you that.\n\nHere's to the Red Sox who contributed to last night's victory.\nAll 20 of them!\n\n-Valentine\n\n###\n\n","completion":" baseball"}

A columnist for the St. \nPaul \"Pioneer Press\" wrote an article giving the \"inside scoop\" on the \nissue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible \ncandiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic \nCenter (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty \nconfident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will \nultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other \ntwo sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the \ninter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can't remember his name) \nbelieves that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also, \nbecause of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed \nuntil (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.  \nHowever, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed, \nbecause the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for \nconventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to \nthis mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future \nviability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even \nfurther.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of \nknocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging \nMinneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be\nbe even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met, \nwhich may happen.\n\tRegarding possible candidates, the three teams are \nHartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota \"\nIce Demons?\") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn't \nbeen announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the \nTarget Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in \nas many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn't be surprised to see \nHartford and Tampa show up there either.\tSo, Minnesota may end up \ngetting another team, but it may take a few years.\n\n\t\n\tGo Sabres!\n\t\n\tRobert Andolina (former Buffalonian living in Minneapolis)\n\trandolin@polisci.umn.edu\n\n###\n\n","completion":" hockey"}

Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started \nwith a solid single to right, moved to second on \"Bob\" Kelly's infield sneaker\ndown the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson's well-placed bunt--a \nrare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense.\n\nCincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth.  He had only \ngiven up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double\nby Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after\nJoe Orselak popped to short.  Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who \nargued plate umpire Kellogg's inside strike by \"drawing the line\" (really, he\nshould know better than that).  Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up getting\ntossed.\n\nThe Mets' fifth started with a Howard Johnson's first-pitch homer.  Pugh must \nhave been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent's\nsingle, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchell\nand turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundley's grounder to the drawn-in Branson\nfailed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game occured:\n\nSaberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield\nto discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  They called it perfectly:\nThompson was hung out to dry after Pugh's first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended.\n(Isn't the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??)\n\nThe Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  After Barry Larkin's\nground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-back\nsingles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long\nfly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, but\nthird base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself was\nhung out to dry killing the Reds rally.\n\nRob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runner\non second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game\nin late August last year when Bonilla's three-run dinger slapped a loss on\nDibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci's season.  Bonilla ended\nup walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a \nweek, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  The win went\nto Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings\nwork, striking out three.  Saberhagen (2-1) got the loss--though I'm a bit\nsurprised he even pitched in the eighth.  I'll take it, though.\n\nThe Reds are now 3-9, still the worst team in baseball with the Royals victory\ntoday.

He sounded like an idiot, much like he did last week\nwhen he said that Teemu would never make it to his 'Rock 'em, Sock 'em' video\nuntil he dropped the gloves...\n\n>On the subject of realignment, Don said that he liked the\n>new division names.\n\nWell, what he _said_ was that even though he's been around the league for quite\nsome time, he still doesn't know who's where w.r.t. conference and division\nnames.  HELLO??!! McFly??  The names have been around for a couple of decades\nor so....he also invited the audience to \"Name the teams in the Wales...quick,\nquick!\" Followed by \"Ah, you don't know, I don't know....\"  \n\nSorry Don.  Wrong on this one.\n\n>Ron (to Don): \"I don't know wy I like you on your show\n>for 30 minutes... I can hardly stand you on this show for 5.\"\n\nThis was absolutely hilarious.\n\nDon's argument about the basketball and baseball brawls was fairly\ngood...unfortunately he neglected to mention the fines that were levelled in\nthe NBA case.  Serious money...oh well, he's never been one for objectivity,\nhas he?\n\nDon's question to Gretzky:\n\n>Wouldn't it be better\n>for you to change your friends so that they like the game, than for\n>us to change the game for your friends?\"\n\nNow this I liked.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" hockey"}

He makes a valid point\nthat injuries shouldn't be an excuse to this club.  Look at the depth of the\nbench this season.. Canadele can play 7 positions; Bass and James are solid\noutfielders and can hit well too; Uribe is nice to have as well..  The\npitching staff has 6 legitimate starters.  We're dealing with a young\nHouston team, so injuries shouldn't play a big role.

Can't believe people actually put\n>win as first in a tie breaker......\n\nGolly, I love stupid people. :-)\nListen, Rex, this is hockey.  The NHL, to be precise.  And in the NHL,\nthere exist these things called \"ties\".  A tie occurs when a game ends\nwith the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie. \nThere also exits these things called \"wins\".  A win is when one team has a\nhigher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other\nat a time, so I can say \"the opponent\".)  A team gets two points for a\nwin.  So, let's say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10\nties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The\nfirst team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86\npoints.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the number\nof wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That's amazing.  So,\nRex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then\nthat's what it means.  In our example, the second team would win the\ntiebreaker and therefore have the \"better\" record, even though both teams\nhad the same number of points.  If you didn't understand this post, Rex,\nmaybe you should go back and read it again, very slowly.\n:-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)\n\n--\n    Keith Keller\t\t\t\tLET'S GO RANGERS!!!!!\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLET'S GO QUAKERS!!!!!\n\tkkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu\t\tIVY LEAGUE CHAMPS!!!!\n\n            \"When I want your opinion, I'll give it to you.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" hockey"}

Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays\n6-3 opening victory.\n\nBut Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick\nKnickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the\nstretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.\n\nKnickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was \nyanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn't played since March 29.\n\nYet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey's backup\nagain and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic\nSaddledome popcorn.\n\n\"If I'm supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I\ndropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?\"  Stauber wondered.  \"Not that I'd be\nhappy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the\nplayoffs.\"\n\nPerhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not\nconvinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.\n\nWhile insisting he is the Kings' \"goalie of the future,\" Melrose said Stauber\nflubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were,\naccording to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New\nYork Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to \nVancouver on Thursday.\n\n\"Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could\nhave taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn't do it,\" Melrose said.  \"An\nelite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a\ngreat goalie is that he isn't satisfied to be a backup.\"\n\n\"I'm not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you're going to be No. 1, you've\ngot to be able to walk your talk.  You've got to be able to play when everything\nis on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect\nmore from him than he does.\"\n\nOuch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the\nteam hit a mid-season slump, didn't play for a month after Knickle was signed\noff the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.\n\n\"I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,\" said Stauber,\na three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only \nto have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.\n\n\"What I've been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated\ndisk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do\nexpect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn't be here.\"\n\n\"Anybody who would disagree with that doesn't know me.  I'm not saying Barry \ndoesn't know me, but don't say I've been without expectations.  If anything, I'm\na perfectionist.\"\n\nStauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. \"But \neven though I didn't play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It's \na bit of a jump,\" he said.  \"You're almost No. 1, or if you play a good game \nyou're No. 1 and if you don't you're No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 \nand then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That's what barry wanted me to explain \nto him, why I didn't come through when he counted on me.  I don't know. What I \ndo know is, it's a sport.  I'll be there.\"\n\nMelrose's \"goalie of the future\" statement doesn't mean much to Stauber. \"Before\nyou know it, I'll be 30 and there will be no future,\" he said.\n\n------\n\n*Game 1 of the Kings @ Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC \nChannel 7 here in LA.  The Kings averaged a 2.1 Nielsen rating in the 10 regular\nseason games aired on Channel 5.\n\nAround the NHL:\n---------------\n*San Jose fired Coach George Kingston, who lead the team to a 11-71-2 mark in \ntheir 2nd NHL season.

Now that the fan has Mike\nLupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the \nbig name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance\nHe did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he \nhad Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.  \n  Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent:\nMorning show:\n  In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi, \nand Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti\nhad a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP tries\nto copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of\nsports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he\ninterjects humor and politics into his show.\n10 AM to 12 Noon:\n  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their\nabilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the\nadvantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller\nwho is asking about who the local team is going to draft\nin the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get\nbetter interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that\nthey were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless\nit was a major story.\n  I would consider this even because they are two different\nstyles of host.\n\n12 Noon to 2 PM:\n  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to \nJody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been\non for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability\nto transcend the \"homer\" mentality of the Philadelphia fan\nbase.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia \nspelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan.\nWhere else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0\nscore without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning 'guys')\nI do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight\nand I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating\nhosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on \neither station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and\nyou can't get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.\n\n2PM to 4PM:\n  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and \nRusso(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided\nin my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining,\nbut they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10\nto 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do\nget great guests and that is the basis for their show, so\nit is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the\nappearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which\nare often hilarious.  \n\n4 PM to 7 PM:\n  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like\nMike Missanelli but I just can't stomach Steve Fredericks.  \nI know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he\nwas at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly\nhomer now.  I don't listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there\nis a game on that night, but you will see later for the \nreason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.\n\n7 PM to Midnight:\n  S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes\nEli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on\ncharges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my\nnerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go\nnuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show)\nOn FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets\nJets, or St. John's basketball.  If the game is on the\nwest coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course\nI think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but\nWIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season.\n(If this is the sports station, why did they lose the\nIGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.))\nDuring the summer, it\nis all talk on WIP.\n\n\nOverall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with\nthe exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and\n12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.   \n\n\n\n            Rich\n-- \n  \"You've read the hat, now see the movie.\"\n                   -Imus in the morning \n  \"A blurb?

He came highly touted as a defensive defenseman, but\nhe's clearly much more than that. Great skater and hard shot (though wish he\nwere more accurate). In fact, he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade away\nthat huge defensive liability Paul Coffey. Kelly Hrudey is only the biggest\ndisappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. But, at best, he's\nonly a mediocre goaltender. A better choice would be Tomas Sandstrom, though\nnot through any fault of his own, but because some thugs in Toronto decided \nto threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. Other than that, the\naward goes to Robert Lang, an uninspiring Czech. Robitaille could easily be\nMVP, but I'd prefer to give it to Rob Blake who is quietly becoming one of the\nleague's premier defensemen, and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the \nrest of our young defense, it could one day mean that we'll let in fewer\ngoals than Hartford. Honorable mentions to Majestic Marty and Warren Rychel.\nJon\n\n###\n\n","completion":" hockey"}

You might have\nto pay a few bucks extra, but you can always find them.  Look on the\nstreet under the message board, or out on the street in front of the Hyatt,\nor even around Gate 1.

{"prompt":"From: mss@netcom.com (Mark Singer)\nSubject: Darrrrrrrrryl\nOrganization: Netcom Online Communications Services (408-241-9760 login: guest)\nLines: 64\n\n\n\nThe media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to\ndeath, but I haven't seen anything in rsb yet.\n\nGerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two\non and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the\nright field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and\nwent into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to\nthe spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he\nmissed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt,\nreached up and caught the ball.  Home run.\n\nNow I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that\nDarryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially\nbehind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate\nvicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with\nStrawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan\nwho caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious\nto where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as\nsoon as he realized he had made the catch.\n\nThat exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry\nwent into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot\nof profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of\ncosting the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled\nfood and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium\nofficials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and\njust relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game,\nLasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a\ntirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about \nwinning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made\nthe catch.\n\nBefore each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech\nwherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that\nare hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any \nthat are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have\nbeen more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility\nof interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he\nis a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated\nhis seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is\nimpossible.\n\nOthers have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what\nthe fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first\nnine games.\n\nI question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull\nhitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play,\nhe certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.\n\nBut I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities\nof the fan.\n\n\n\n--\tThe Beastmaster\n\n\n\n-- \nMark Singer    \nmss@netcom.com\n\n###\n\n","completion":" baseball"}

It's not really clear that their staff is better than last year. If\nRussell does well, Darwin doesn't go on the DL, and Hesketh doesn't pitch\njust barely well enough to avoid losing his spot in the rotation, they could\nbe better. On the other hand, if Hesketh pitches miserably and they're too\nstupid to move him to the pen and bring up Conroy or somebody, Fossas\ncontinues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue he's a\nlefty, and Russell explodes they could be pretty bad.\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com\n\nGod is a comedian playing to an audience that is afraid to laugh.\n\t- Mark Twain\n\n###\n\n","completion":" baseball"}

Even the best hitters can succeed only 2\/5 of the time in\ntheir best years, but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts - taking all\nthe players in their prime, they might throw 50 shutouts in a year.

Santiago's\nnumbers would probably come out the same as Sandy's, but I don't have\nthe league data from the mid-80s to check it out.\n\nThat being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to\nstart the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league\nseason in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very\npoorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real.

Since Hartford is pitiful, the\nIslanders played pitiful.  Since Pittsburgh is great, the Isles will most\nlikely play great.  This is most likely due to inexperience and very poor\nshooting.  To Greg: yes, I have noticed that the Islanders couldn't hit\nthe broad side of a barn with the puck if they were two feet in front of\nit.  Does anyone have shooting percentages?

I've also noticed that he usually gets away with it. Just\nas examples last night, I noticed him elbowing Scott Stevens in the\nhead, which basically started the whole shoving match that got Stevens\n(Scott) and Tocchet 2 minute minors. He also KICKED John McLean. Of\ncourse he wasn't called for that. Isn't kicking an automatic match\npenalty and 10 game suspension? I think Glenn Anderson got one a few\nyears ago for kicking Gaetan Duchesne in the chest. There's no doubt in\nmy mind that Barasso is the dirtiest golatender since Hextall. He's also\nvery good.\n\nHow about that Tocchet head-butt? Is there an automatic susppension that\ngoes along with a (non-kicking) match penalty? I can't remember anymore.\n\nOh, the playoffs should be fun,\nRalph\n\n###\n\n","completion":" hockey"}

Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the\nstretch to preserve the Blues lead.\n\nThe Hawks came out strong in the first period, outshooting the Blues 6-1 and\ntaking a 1-0 lead on Noonan's first goal. Right after an interference penalty\non Rick Zombo had expired, Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the\nblue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle. Larmer fired\na long slap shot, and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph's pads. After\nthe goal, the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks\n10-9 in the first period.\n\nJeff Brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second. Nelson Emerson broke in on\nthe left side, got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Belfour\ncame out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where Brown\ncollected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal.\n\nTwo minutes later on a Hawks power play, Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a\nshort-handed break-in. Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy\nRoenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass\nacross the slot. Noonan fired it past Joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead.\n\nNoonan completed his hat trick 3:11 later to increase the Hawks' lead to 3-1.\nStephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat\nStephane Quintal by driving to the net. Joseph had no chance as Noonan\ndeflected the puck in the net.\n\nDenny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 3-1 at 12:49 after picking up the\nrebound of Basil McRae's slap shot from the slot. Janney set up McRae for\nthe shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards\nto Felsner. Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. The Blues\noutshot the Hawks 10-5 in the second period.\n\nWith the Blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9:56 of the third, Stephane Matteau picked\nup a high sticking penalty. Just 53 seconds into the power play, Steve Smith\nwas called for slashing, giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07.\n\nThe Blues didn't waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds into\nthe two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. Janney found Hull in the slot,\nand Hull fired a rocket at Belfour. Jeff Brown collected the rebound and\npassed it to Shanahan in the left circle. Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp\nangle.\n\nJust 17 seconds later, Hull scored the game winner for the Blues.

I\nwould rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all.\n\n2) I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an\nimpressive win last week. NOw Otto's latest debacle has restored Simmon's\nreputation. Now he looks like he is back in his '92 form when he had the\nAL's highest ERA among starters. Four our sake(not Ted's sake), I hope he\npitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right.\n\n3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently.\nBUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have\nshown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a little\nbit worse. Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters.\nMerced had a very good OBA his rookie year. He showed a lot of concentration at\nthe plate in his rookie year.\n\n4) Walk: Well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think that\nWalk desrved his contract.\n\n5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. I\ncan't understand his and management's fear of losing Tom Prince through\nwaivers. Even if they do, what's the use. He is aright hander like Slaught.\nNot a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving him\nway too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaught\nshould have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed\npitching). Didn't Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year, and attempt to\ntrade LaValliere last year itself? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere\nwasn't very fit last year.\n\n6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!!\n7) Candeleria: Well, he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the\nseason. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million  plus? Come on. Other\nthan the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks,\nPatterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to have\npitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the money\non Patterson in stead.\n\n8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.\n\n9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke.\n10) Slaught: How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year? NOw his\nvalue has increased immensely.\n\n11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount.\nLet's see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better.\nNow why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better\nthan a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won't be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.\n\n12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement\nin favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that\nidiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay.\n13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The\nRF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace\ntwo of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a\nvery respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have\na respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit\nleft handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options\nfor the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon's tenure was\ngetting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.\n\n14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave.\nthey will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed.\nNow, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots,\nnothing else will.\n\nOn a final note. Tim Wakefield won't be as awful as he was in his last 2\nstarts. BUt don't count on him pitching like last year for the rest of\nthe season. Also, if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the\nseason, they will miss Redus's clutch hitting and his speed(he has peaked\nin the second half of the last 2 seasons)>\n\n\n-Pravin Ratnam\n\n###\n\n","completion":" baseball"}

As outsiders, it's fine for \nus to say, \"He should hire a different coach.\"  In fact, he has talked about\ndoing so in the past.  But, the press (here in Detroit, at least) has so\nbuilt up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of\nthe playoffs as a coach, that I think he has taken it upon himself to \nprove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the second\nround.  He needs to, as the papers say, \"get that monkey off his back.\"\nSo it becomes a matter not of intelligence, but of pride.  Is it foolish\nto let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps, but we're all\na little that way from time to time.  I think eventually he'll step down\nfrom behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties, and the team will\nimprove as a result.\n\nI think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent\non GM work.  In that sense, once he steps down as coach, we'll see how\ngood of a GM he really is.\n\n>But Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GM\n>so none of this is true anyway.\n\nI may not agree with everything you've said, but it's been fun discussing\nit with you.\n\n>Gregmeister\n\n--Randy\n\n###\n\n","completion":" hockey"}

In the San Jose area we have a population of 800,000\nand that population is served by 2 ice arenas.  In contrast, Kamloops,\nBritish Columbia has a population of about 50,000 and has 5 rinks!  There\nare also myriad ponds, pools, etc that freeze in the winter.  Down here\nit's hard to find a kid without a bicycle; up there it's hard to find a kid\nwithout a pair of skates.  And before you say \"what does he know? He's from\nCalifornia.\" let me say that I was born and raised in Trail, British Columbia,\na town of about 8,000 with lots of ice in the winter.  My father did radio\nplay by play for the local team, the Trail Smokeaters, who by  the way, were\nthe last Canadian team to win the World Championship (back in 1961).

Both my kids play for\nthe Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season, which just ended,\ncost me $75 per kid for membership in Hockey USA, plus $750 per kid for club\ndues.  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club dues\ncover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  Other areas have similar fees, unless\nthe city government subsidises some of the costs, as Stockton does.\n\nBy the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the \"inner city\"\nareas.  Eastridge and Vallco are exceptions ... Redwood City's rink is in an\nindustrial area on Bay Rd, near 101, Berkeley's is near Ashby and Martin Luther\nKing, Stockton's is in Oak Park, Sacramento's is in an older section of downtown\n(I forget the name of the street), Fresno's is out on the edge of town, just west\nof 99.  Santa Rosa's is a nice rink, but it's in an older section of town.\nDublin's is outside of town, off 580.  Most of the rinks are old, and expensive\nto run, with huge electric bills and insurance premiums.  If you want to buy ice\ntime expect to pay around $100 per hour at any of these rinks.  Some of them\ngive you a 60 minute hour for your money; others give you a 50 minute hour and\ninclude the resurfacing time in the fee.\n\n\n-- \nAlan Hepburn           \"A man doesn't know what he knows\nNational Semiconductor       until he knows what he doesn't know.\"\nSanta Clara, Ca              \nalan@berlioz.nsc.com                              Thomas Carlyle\n\n###\n\n","completion":" hockey"}

Any kind of \"proof\" you sent it on the\nweekend will help your case.  :-)  Seriously, this is only a fun pool and\nI trust each person to be honest.\n\nAgain, sorry for any inconvenience, and I hope the pool is still fun for you.\n\n\t- Andrew\n\n\nUSENET Hockey Playoff Draft Standings\n\nPosn\tTeam\t\t\t\tPts\tRem\tLast Posn\n\n1.\tSneddon Scorers                 43\t25\t(--)\n2.\tThe Borg                        42\t25\t(--)\n\tDave Wessels                    42\t25\t(--)\n4.\tBruce's Rented Mules            41\t25\t(--)\n\tGreat Expectations              41\t25\t(--)\n\tHurricane Andrew                41\t25\t(--)\n\tJerky Boys                      41\t24\t(--)\n\tHomesick Hawaiian               41\t25\t(--)\n9.\tgive you money monday           40\t25\t(--)\n\tEinstien's Punk Band            40\t25\t(--)\n11.\tZipper Heads                    39\t25\t(--)\n\tTapio Repo                      39\t25\t(--)\n\tDetroit Homeboy                 39\t25\t(--)\n\tthe dead ducks                  39\t25\t(--)\n\tMike Burger                     39\t25\t(--)\n\tTest Department                 39\t25\t(--)\n\tTeam Elvis                      39\t25\t(--)\n\tCraig team                      39\t25\t(--)\n19.\tSkate or Die                    38\t25\t(--)\n\tDebbie Bowles                   38\t25\t(--)\n\tFuzzfaces Galore                38\t25\t(--)\n\tsuds                            38\t25\t(--)\n\tThe Campi Machine               38\t25\t(--)\n\tzachmans wingers                38\t25\t(--)\n\tSean Forbes                     38\t25\t(--)\n\tThreepeat                       38\t25\t(--)\n\tFlamming Senators               38\t25\t(--)\n\tTeam Awesome                    38\t25\t(--)\n\tA.P.

There is only one way of determin-\ning \"best\" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at\nthe  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best\nthat day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the\nmost  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the\nbest of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro-\ncess  used to determine the \"best\" is the score of the game and it re-\nlates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method\ninherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that\nis how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.\n\nTo say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-\nsolutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B\nin their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.\n\nIf you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has\ndone  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you\nhave  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the\nindividual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the\nonly measure of \"best\" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base-\nball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham-\npionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub-\njective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can\npredict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.\n\n>The fact is that Morris didn't \"win\" any ballgames, Toronto did, in\n>spite of Morris' \"contribution\".   This has been explained to you\n\nExactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  with\nClemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens.\nI am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally\nmeaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on\nhis ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.\n\n>many, many times and you are either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp it.\n\nYou don't have to be rude.\n\n>You are completely consumed by the post hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy.\n\nFor you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point\nof  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio\nElenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because\nhe   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed\nthat in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an\nindividual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose of\ncomparing that individual's performance with another individual's per-\nformance.\n\nThe stats are a nice hobby and  that's  about  it.  There  is  no  new\nknowledge being produced.  So when a poster claims that Morris is better\nthan Clemens because he has more rings, the poster is no more nor less \nincorrect than the rest of you baying hounds.\n\n-- \n\ncordially, as always,                      maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca \n                                           \"So many morons...\nrm                                                   ...and so little time.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" baseball"}

Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom \n played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up\n Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge\n to Sweden in creating more opportunities.\n Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi\n made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but\n Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada\n started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked\n hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson\n who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and\n made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada.\n The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot\n that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.\n Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took\n a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by\n the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1.\n Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure\n but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal.\n At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to\n cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it.\n That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in \n the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he\n explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close\n to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal.\n Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a\n bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas\n then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.\n The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a\n rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds\n in the dressing room.\n\n A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing\n great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better\n than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best\n goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.\n Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is\n easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well,\n Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.\n\n The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden's best along with Larsson-Juhlin-\n Nilsson. Swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the\n task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros, and managed this very well.\n Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC, and considering\n that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game, he played very\n well.

But I'd like to differ with your opinion about \"a city\nwhich is likely to pour in the votes...\".\n\nI attended many games last year during the balloting.  I know that a\ngreat number of the attendees DID NOT fill out their ballots, but left\nthem, beer soaked and torn on the floor of the stands.  Toronto gets\nno more and no less votes than any other city for the All Star game.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not a one time thing.  I've attended games\nduring the last four seasons, and it has happened every time.  The\napathetic attitude to All Star ballots really offends me.\n\nLjs\n\n###\n\n","completion":" baseball"}

Good thing, because the Blues quit\nplaying.\n\nThey held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared\nwith 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep\nand barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.\nTampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating\nsupervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the\nshot had gone into the net after time had expired.\n\n``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end,\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.\n\nIf the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues'\ndisappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making\nthe playoffs tempered Berry's anger.\n\n``It wasn't pretty at the end,\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as\ngood as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, but\nit did.\"\n\nStill, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end.\nDespite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this\nseason, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks\nin a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at\nChicago Stadium.\n\nThe Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,\ntheir fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points\nbehind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,\nwhich played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its\nfirst season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.\n\nThe poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous\nBlues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.\n\n``It's a shame we let down,\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score\ntwo goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.\n``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would have\nended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\"\n\nInstead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.\n``We won, and that's all that matters,\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3\nfor the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\"\n\nSome players didn't have a problem.\n\n``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit,\" said Rich\nSutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You\ncan't allow five goals like we did, that's not right.\n\n``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\"\n\nBassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow,\nhe missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss.\n\n``I didn't know it was final,\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the\nbench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs,\nand that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the\nend.\"\n\nThe letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard\noperators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score\nshowed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third\nperiod. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.\n\n``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,\"\nBerry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took.\"\n\nIf Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might\nbother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.\n\nUntil the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd\ngoing at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,\nMiller and Bassen took charge late in the period.\n\nWith the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked\ndefenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the\nrebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.\n\nThen, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski\nafter defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.\n\nBassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the \nrebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of\nthe season and reminded him of a special friend.\n\nLast year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form\nof cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.\n\n``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\" Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, and\nI know he was watching. I know he's happy.\"\n\nMiller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo\nat 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 seconds\nlater, making it 5-1.\n\nLess than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Bergland\nscored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass\nfrom Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.\n\nThen, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third\nperiod, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals\nto Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third\nperiod.\n\nThe goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the\nwinner. ``We were in there,\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.\"\n\n  %*%*%*%**%*%%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*\n  *   __  ______________         ____________________________________    % \n  %   \\ \\_)____________\/         A L L E Z   L E S   B L U E S  ! ! !    * \n  *    \\    __________\/          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    % \n  %     \\    ________\/                                                   *\n  *      \\   _______\/                  Joe Ashkar                        % \n  %       \\  \\                         Contact for the Blues             *\n  *        \\  \\  SAINT LOUIS           jca2@cec1.wustl.edu               % \n  %        (___)             BLUES                                       * \n  *%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%\n\n###\n\n","completion":" hockey"}

Brown terminated the two women's teams as\nuniversity-funded sports in May 1991, allowing them to continue to\ncompete against varsity teams if they could raise their own funds for\nuniforms, travel, coaches, and all other expenses.  They had also\nbeen denied admission preferences for use in recruiting new members.\n   \"This is a major victory for women and the cause of equal rights,\"\nsaid TLPJ lead counsel Lynette Labinger of Providence's Roney &\nLabinger.  \"Universities across America need to reevaluate their\nprograms quickly.

They should finish ahead of\nthe Royals, Mariners, and *possibly* Athletics.  But I don't think\nthey'll be above .500.  (I think the East is stronger this year.)\n\nLast year their pitching was bad and their offense was horrible.  This\nyear their offense is better, but their pitching is still pretty bad.\nEven if Finley returns to form, he won't replace what they lost in\nAbbott.  Sanderson?  Farrell?  I don't believe it.\n\nAnd while their BA may be good, and they have decent speed, their\noffense lacks punch.  They don't have any bona fide power hitters.\n(Salmon, Snow, Davis, and Curtis?  None with more than 20 HR\npotential.)\n\nCheers,\n-Valentine\n\nP.S. Which AL team had the most steals last week?  Those go-go Tigers!\nThe mediots finally managed to convince them that they needed \"more\nbalance\" in their lineup.  You see, they were scoring too many runs\ntoo consistently.

Smith\ncame out from behind his own net and fired a breakout pass that hit Fuhr in the\nback of the leg. Fuhr was backing up at the time and never saw what\nhappened. The puck went straight off Fuhr's leg and into the net. Fuhr never\nhad a chance. There was no play back to the goaltender, in fact Perry Berezan\nof Calgary had just dumped it in and Smith was retrieving it. \n\nIt was unfortunate that it happened; Smith is a nice guy and was only a rookie\nat the time, and on his birthday too. But all the blame lies with him. Starting\nin pee-wee coaches tell players never to make a cross-ice pass in front of \ntheir own net. Too much chance of having it intercepted, or hitting the \ngoaltender, or whatever.\n\nAnd to the people who say that Smith cost the Oilers the series, I can only\nsay that he certainly didn't cause the team to lose the other three games.\nThere was no reason for a powerhouse team like Edmonton to be tied late\nin the third period of the 7th game of the second round.

But \n>the facts are that Morris has shown us that he can win and Clemens\n>hasn't.\n\nWhat on earth does this mean? Over their careers, Clemens has \"won\" 68% of\nthe games he's started, Morris 58%. Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17\nwins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventing\nthe other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? If\nso, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs\/9 innings pitched. Morris\nallows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never in\nhis career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens' career ERA. But\nI forget, in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance\nto Buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had Morris been on the Sox, it\nwould have been a routine groundout, right?\n\n>Whether or not Clemens is better by your standard of measurement\n>is totally meaningless.

Your\ncontinued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to\nany of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have\nspent a few too many games in goal without a mask.\n\n>>Don't give me that shit.

Stop crying about it and\n>get on with life.\n\nNo one is crying; the Jays won, and as a team they certainly deserved to win\nat least the AL East. They performed well in two short series and won the\nWorld Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope they\nkeep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when they\ntraded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical link\nbetween Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man\nwas credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runs\nout, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992,\ngave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.\n\nSeriously, Roger, I'd really like to hear your explanation of the difference\nbetween the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher,\nand why? Did Morris somehow \"learn how to win\" in the intervening ten years?\nIf so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with Minnesota with an ERA over half\na run lower than 1992?\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com\n\nDon't be humble, you're not that great.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" baseball"}

And enlightening.\n\nHere's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco,\ncirca June 1986.\n\n1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,\n    not gain more bulk.\n\n2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's\n    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed.\n\n3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like\n    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is\n    released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -\n    Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his\n    stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,\n    they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard\n    to make adjustments in your swing.\n\nWhat would I do, if I were Jose?\n\nAside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,\nso that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing.\n\nFirst, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,\nand severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this\nwill cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move\nthe bathead more freely.\n\nSecond, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.\n\nThird, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find\nmy 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling\nthe wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength\n is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of\nthe park.\n\nIf Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back\nproblems, he'll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could\nstill hit 600+ HR.\n\n\n-- \n*   Gary Huckabay   * \"You think that's loud enough, a$$hole?\"           *\n*   \"Movie Rights   * \"Well, if you're having trouble hearing it, sir,   *\n*   available thru  *  I'd be happy to turn it up for you.

Have you even LOOKED at Dave Winfield's  \nslugging percentage for three or 4 of his best seasons. I still think that  \ndave was one of the BETTER of all time, but obviously not the best. He was  \none of the best athletes evr to play baseball. He hit line drives that hit  \nthe scoreboard in left-center field, a feat np one has done in the new  \nStadium. Heck, only 2 or 3 other people have hit it over that green fence  \nsince it has been remodeled. He could field, had a bullet arm, and his  \nhitting was comparable in many seasons to gary sheffields, and barry bonds  \nof last season. He is older now, and slowing down, takes more of an  \nuppercut to lift the ball out of the park, but he will always be my hero,  \nand my idol. There is nothing that could make me happier than George  \ninviting Dave back to the Bronx to play his last year of ball with the  \nYankees. Of course, he will most likely refuse the offer, but who knows?  \nFor 3 million dollars, he'll play. Heck they are giving gallego 2.5  \nmillion this year, having Dave as their DH, while leaving him time to play  \nthe field when Tartabull is injured, or Nokes and mass are traded, should  \ngive the Yanks the inspiration and leadership that will sweep in a new age  \nof Yankee domination.\n\n\nMichael Lurie\n\n###\n\n","completion":" baseball"}

As far as I\ncan tell he doesn't have any particular problem in his mechanics\n(such as Sasser).  He might be a little rough around the edges in blocking\nthe ball, or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to\nclear that up is playing and practice time.  I can't see how repetitions\nat AAA are any better then reps in the majors!  \n\n\tAll we're left with is the calling the game aspect.  Olsen  and\nBerryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping\nthe pitchering staff.  But this is a reputation that is given to almost\nall veteran catchers.  How is catching at AAA going to help Lopez learn\nthe major league pitching staff?  The only way any catcher is going to\nlearn Tom Glavine's pitches is to catch Tom Glavine.  Similarly, I wouldn't\nbe supprised if the pitcher's claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen over\npitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen.  But \ngiven time they will say they are comfortable with Lopez.\n\n\tNow, since Lopez can't learn how to handle the major league\npitcher's while he's in AAA and since he doesn't have any glaring\nproblem in his mechanics, what is he going to learn in AAA that he\ncan't learn just as well while in the majors?  \n\nDave\n__________\nDave Bonar\nmebonar@lsuvax.sncc.lsu.edu\n__________\n\n###\n\n","completion":" baseball"}

{"prompt":"From: nlu@Xenon.Stanford.EDU (Nelson Lu)\nSubject: SHARKS REVIEW Part 1: Goaltenders\nOrganization: Computer Science Department, Stanford University.\nLines: 80\n\nAs the Sharks' season came to a close tonight, I will start a series of posts,\ntrying to revisit the players, the trades, the moves, etc., that went through\nfor the Sharks for the past season.  If you are uninterested, since I will\nhave the words SHARKS REVIEW in the subject heading in these postings, you can\nkill them.\n\nI will first try to evaluate how the players did.  These ratings, of course,\nare subject to my own biases, but I hope that I can try to be as objective as\npossible.  I will evalute players who finished the season with the Sharks\nand\/or did not play for another NHL team this season.\n\nThus, then, let's go to the goaltenders...\n\n#1\tBRIAN HAYWARD\t\tSeason:\t11th\nAcquired:\t'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tP (D)\n\nIt is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end, a career that\nfeatured sharing three Jennings Trophies (with Patrick Roy, in '87, '88, and\n'89).  It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing\ngrade (and skip the letter grading), but he had simply been awful on ice this\nyear, save for a bright spot or two, and even if he had been healthy, he would\nnot be any more than the 3rd-string goalie.\n\nBut Hayward was a classy individual, who also figured in on the Sharks' first\never victory, the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames.\nAs he retires, the fans will remember what a good guy he was.\n\n#30\tJEFF HACKETT\t\tSeason: 3rd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from N. Y. Islanders in expansion draft\nGrade:\t\tC\n\nHackett, after (deservedly) winning the team MVP honors last season, simply\nwasted the year.  Other than a few good spots (57 saves against Los Angeles,\nalmost-shutout against Tampa Bay, etc.), Hackett, finishing with 85.6% save\npercentage and a 5.28 GAA, watched his status go from the team's #1 goalie to\nbench decoration at the end of the season.  He was expected, early, to carry\nthe team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an early\ninjury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor,\nbut upon return, he simply wasn't up to the task.  He may not return next\nyear.\n\n#31\tWADE FLAHERTY\t\tSeason: 1st (still eligible as rookie)\nAcquired:\t'91-92, signed as undrafted free agent\nGrade:\t\tI (A-)\n\nIt is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus the\nincomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the Calgary\nFlames), Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods.  He started\nthe season poorly in Kansas City, but finished strong, prompting the Blades'\nowner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP\nhonors.  The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he\ntries to make it into the NHL; last year, he was a capable backup for Arturs\nIrbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs, picking up\nall-star honors along with Irbe; now it's time for him to show that he can\nshare the job with Irbe next year, because with prospects Dan Ryder, Trevor\nRobins, and Scott Cashman coming along, if he doesn't make it next year, he\nmay not ever.\n\n#32\tARTURS IRBE\t\tSeason:\t1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tB+\n\nI may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that\nhe's a bona fide NHL goaltender, perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender.  He has\nprovided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had, getting\nthe team's first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26.\nHe has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck and\nmaking passes, reminding people of a young Ron Hextall (except, of course, the\ngoonism).  Yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to do\nwith such a bad defense in front of him, but if the Sharks are to challenge for\na playoff spot next season, Irbe's the key, as he demonstrated in being named\nas a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts.\n\n===============================================================================\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

However, although baseball\n\thas adjusted to the presence of black players, many Hispanic\n\tplayers still labor under the stereotype of being \"fireballs,\n\thot blooded, flashy\".  The report also emphasised that despite\n\tthe rantings (my word) of Jessie Jackson about baseballs\n\tdiscrimination against black players in its upper echelons,\n\tbaseball has actually done much better by black players than\n\tHispanic players.\n\n\tAnother interesting point was the language barrier problem.  The\n\treporter elaborated on an interview with Ruben Sierra which he\n\tgave in Spanish to a Spanish speaking newspaper reporter with\n\tthe fact that there are maybe 2 major baseball writers that\n\tspeak Spanish, despite the fact that Spanish is one of (if not\n\tthe) easiest languages to learn, so easy that the author Cormac\n\tMcCarthy learned Spanish at age 50 in order to research his\n\tbook, _All The Pretty Horses_.  Yet, few MLB organizations\n\temploy Spanish speaking personel, one of the exceptions being\n\tthe Oakland A's.\n\n\tAnother point:\n\n\tNearly 90% of Latin American players have some African blood.\n\tYet, most report that they'd never really felt black until\n\tplaying ball in the US.\n\n  \n\tIronically enough, it is the early presence of Latin American\n\tbaseball players in the Major Leagues that support the idea that\n\tbaseball was integrated before the arrival of Jackie Robinson,\n\tas many \"light black\" or \"brown\", Latin Americans were\n\tincorporated into baseball. \n\n\t\/S\n-- \n\"I did not know the cure for the disease      ------------------- \n of images, but I believed in the healing     |  Sandra Vigil   | \n power of words and stories.\"                 |  vigil@esca.com |    \n             - Until the End of the World     -------------------\n\n###\n\n","completion":" baseball"}

Whether that player is\nin Kindersley, Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk, Russia, if the GM believes him\nto be the better player, the GM should be drafting him.\n\nWhere do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league, when referring to Canadian\nplayers.  It doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the owners.  The owners\ncan do what they want.  While a 'Canadian content' rule might be enforcable\nhere in Canada, there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US\nthat the CFL (sorry for the football reference) didn't even TRY to push their\nimport ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers.\n\nIncreasing the competition for the 'elite' positions, in most cases, would\nmake players better anyways.

Jagr did not have a better season than\n     Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of\n     hockey knowledge.  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty\n     plus\/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.\n\n     Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice\n     time per game and some measure of its \"quality\" (i.e., is the player put out\n     in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up\n     against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would\n     much rather see the +\/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious\n     merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.\n\nThank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the\nfact that Jagr has a much higher +\/- than Francis, I can assure you\nthat I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +\/-\ncomparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone\nwould argue that Jagr's higher +\/- actually reflected better two-way\nplay.\n\nIn my opinion, Francis's low +\/- is purely a result of him being asked\nto play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he\ncan chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team's top center\nis a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +\/- suffers.  On the\nother hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can't even get\n90 points, no matter how inflated his +\/- is.\n\n(By the way, don't get me wrong -- I like Jagr.

Part of\nthat may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the\nPadres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and\njudging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play\nthird.\n\n>Williams, Matt       ----  ----  .633  .653  .656   0.647\nAdd another to the elite fielders list.\n\n>Caminiti, Ken        ----  .675  .630  .653  .596   0.642\n>Sabo, Chris          .751  .626  .616  .613  .575   0.642\nToo fielders whose career average may overstate their value.

The Yankees and Indians, tied for fourth place, had 76 wins.\n\nNow I should think it is obvious that the Red Sox improved more than\nthe Indians or Tigers.  Basically, the Red Sox are stronger this year\nat 1B, DH, SS, LF, and RF.  They have healthier starting pitchers (so\nfar, at least) and better relievers.  I see no reason why they\nshouldn't win ~85 games.  Meanwhile, the Indians are in shambles and\nthe Tigers *still* have no pitching.  They will win some 20-3\nblowouts, but they will lose an awful lot of 7-5 games too.\n\n*MAYBE* the Sox will play poorly, win 78 games, and finish fifth.\nBut I think third or fourth place is more likely.\n\nCheers,\n-Valentine\n\n###\n\n","completion":" baseball"}

A low GAA against good\n> teams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context\n> of comparing two goaltenders.\n\nLet's start over.  I'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  I'd\ntake Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1\nnetminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than\nthat after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records\nare similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel as\nthe most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.\n\nYou say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well\nbe, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in\nthose games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh,\nthe defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.\n\n> The same\n> for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a\n> great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If\n> you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.\n\nBut I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him play\nfor the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's just\nmy opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that\nabout Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'm\nbatting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.\n\nAs for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the\noffensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the\nsave.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't\nget the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that's\nwhat the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the\nshooter to beat him.\n\n> But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie\n> stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel\n> doesn't have a game like that in him.\n\nI seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on\nopening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending\nchamps.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was\nsenational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that a\nMontreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game\nand just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are\npart of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.\n\nAnyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and\nI'm not going to argue about it anymore.  Besides, with the current\n7-game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year, I\ndon't want to piss you off to the point that you don't sell me any\ntickets next season:-).\n\n                                         \\ \\\nJoe Dakes                                 \\\/\\\nAT&T Microelectronics                      \\\/\\\n555 Union Boulevard                         \\ \\\nAllentown, PA  18103                     LET'S GO FLYERS! \nalux1!jmd                                     \\ \\\njmd@aluxpo.att.com                             \\ \\__________\n                                                \\____\/_\/\/__\/\n\n###\n\n","completion":" hockey"}

So far, no takers.\nPersonally, I think Harris is a defensive liability, and he\nhas also led the team in past years for hitting into double\nplays, or at least been among the leaders.\n \nSharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play\nevery day, he can get the job done.  If Sharpy played just\none base every day, say third, he'd also improve defensively.\n \nWallach has helped tremendously on defense, as has Reed.\nThe improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an\neffect on the pitching staff.  Both Astacio AND Martinez\nwere bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays.\nMartinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might\nhave seen him lifted in the third in past years.\n \nAstacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances.\nThe Dodgers are turning double plays, and keeping more balls\nin the infield than last year.  And Piazza has also been great\non defense.  He has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to\nsteal and has at least one pick off at first.\n \nWallach, clearly, has contributed to the over all improvement on\ndefense.  But his offense is awful and he has cost the Dodgers\nsome runs.

The goalie\nwho gets back his all-star form (Roy or Hextall) can win the series\nfor his team.\n\nEposode Summary\n---------------\nThis episode took place rinkside. Don was holding a hot dog that\nhe bought from the concession stand.\n\nRon Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the\nToronto Sun. It featured a picture of Don, who just saw his shadow\nand proclaimed \"Will you look at dat, eh? Means another 6 weeks\nof me. Beauty.\"\n\nNext, Don talked about the hot dog he was holding. According to\nhim, the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all\nthe arenas in the NHL.\n\nFrom there, Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game. The game\nhad great flow, because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game\nin the NHL. In contrast, the Calgary-LA game was terrible... All\nstop-and-go, over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgary\nby Dan Marouelli. Its getting so that the ref who calls the most\npenalties gets to ref in the finals.\n\nNext, Ron showed an old picture of Don, when he was playing for\nthe Rochester Americans of the AHL. Don recalled some of the\nwins that he had in the Quebec arena... during the Memorial cup\nand the AHL championships.\n\nFinally, Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the\nRangers.

{"prompt":"From: slegge@kean.ucs.mun.ca\nSubject: Leafs versus Wings\nLines: 46\nOrganization: Memorial University. St.John's Nfld, Canada\n\nHow long can the Leafs play short-handed and still be expected to\nscore?  They did some fine penely-killing in the first (2 men down\nfor a couple of minutes at one point) but they just couldn't keep it \nup.  They spent virtually the entire game either short-handed or\njust coming off a penelty -- as soon as they'd get re-grouped, they're\npenalized again!\n \nSheesh -- like Gilmour said after the 1st -- you can't go calling \nevery little push an shove in a game like that.  And if you're going\nto, you have to do it for both teams.\n \nPearson (one of my four favorite Leafs) played like a bonehead -- I\nsaw him personally screw up at least 2 good scoring opportunities, and\nthen he got that *bonehead* 5-minute major high-sticking penalty.\n \nCullen has gotten stronger since his return from injury a hand-full of\ngames ago and he played a good game.  If the other players on his line\ncan smarten up, that line should do okay.  Clark's got to get tough --\nhe's got to intimidate and go for the net.  Send Clark up the left \nwing over the blue line a couple times... his patented wrist shot will\nput some numbers on the board... and Pearson... heck, maybe he should\nbe benched.\n \nI hate to repeat Grapes, but where the heck was Foligno?  Zezel can't\ndo all the checking himself -- and get MacLlwain on the move... we \nneed some speed out there!  Keep Potvin in net, he did okay \nconsidering... although (like I said a couple weeks ago) Potvin \nmessed up in a couple games in the AHL playoffs last year -- he can \neasily do it again.\n \nMy prediction last week was Toronto in 7 -- that the games DET wins \nwill be blow-outs and the game TOR wins will be close -- I still stand\nby that.\n \nDon't fret, Leafs fans, in order to win in 7, the other team has to\nwin 3! :-)\n \nBurns is going to make some magic -- he'll mix up some lines.  Match\nthe Wings line-per-line.  He'll have his team checking hard, and he'll\nnever let them get out-numbered in their own end.  The Leafs will win\nWednesday night... and will take 1 or their home games (probably the\nfirst one).\n \nStephen LEAF Legge\nSLEGGE@kean.ucs.mun.ca\n\n###\n\n","completion":" hockey"}

North-ame-\nricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks. An average\neuropean player from Sweden, Finland, Russian or Tsech\/Slovakia is a better \nskater and  puckhandler than his NHL colleague. Especially defenders in NHL\nare mainly slow and clumsy. Sel{nne has also said that in the Finnish Sm-league\ngame is more based on skill than in NHL. In Finland he couldn't get so many \nbreakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than in\nNHL. Also Alpo Suhonen said that in NHL Sel{nne's speed accentuates because\nof clumsy defensemen.\n\nI have to admit that the best players come from Canada, but those regulars\naren't as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues. Also top europeans\nare in the same level as the best north-americans.(except Lemieux is in the\nclass of his own). \n\nTommi\n\n###\n\n","completion":" hockey"}

Mario Lemieux is the explanation, IMHO.  \n\n>You could make a case that the *expectation* of an improving team that\n>would make the playoffs is the reason. \n\nFunny you should mention it...this is exactly the case I was going to make.\n\n>But I think the reason is Lemieux\n>had a 168 point season and was the first non-Gretzky to win the Hart and\n>Ross since 1980.  People turned out to watch him play. \n\nI will grant that a star like Mario will draw fans, even if the team sucks. \nBut this is short term only; I still do not think the attendance increase \nwill last, unless the team is a winning\/competitive\/improving\/butt-kicking\none.  Pittsburgh was still getting better, so people continued to support\nthem.  If they suddenly dropped to, say, 50 points, you'd have knee surgery\nfor some of the people jumping off the bandwagon.  \n\n>Also, the following year (88-89) the Pens had 89 points not 87. \n\nOk.  My numbers came from the NHL Guide and Record Book. \n\n>They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario, that is \n>true.  But the improvement in attendance came before they started doing\n>this (Coffey late in 1987) and before they even had a playoff bound team.\n>A doubling of attendance occured in 1984-85 from the previous year.  An\n>increase from 38 points to 53 points is not going to do that.  The arrival\n>of Mario Lemieux is what did it. \n\nYou can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it.  But my point is that\nit wasn't Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e.\na winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And\nbefore anybody jumps in and says I'm nit-picking and mincing words, go back\nand read from where this thread started...\n\nIt might help to think about what would go through a fan's mind who suddenly\nfound an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it \"gee, Mario Lemieux is\namazing, I'll go watch him play\", or was it \"gee, now we've got a *kick*\n*ass* guy on *our* side, I'll go watch him play\".  I think it was the latter.\n\n> Similar thing happened in L.A.   Before\n>Gretzky's arrival, about 12000 per game.  After, constant sellouts.  They\n>are STILL selling out every game despite showing little or no improvement\n>since Gretzky's first year there.  How do you explain it?  People are going\n>to see Gretzky.  they certainly aren't going to see a winner, they haven't\n>GOT a winner.  They've had MUCH better teams in their past history than\n>they currently have, yet they didn't draw as well then.\n\nI don't think this is accurate.  The *tickets* sell, but people don't go to\nthe games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket\nholders in LA don't always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings\ninitial success following Gretzky's arrival (68 to 91 points, same source)\nand corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in\nattendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.  \n\nWhether or not the Kings are a 'winner' is debatable.  I claim that since\nGretzky's arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim\nthat McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler\ndynasty...but that's another story and included only because I don't like\nMcNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and\nthat undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising\nsales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little\ntailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the\nForum even if the tickets were sold.\n\n>I think in the case of a Lemieux or Gretzky, the player can transcend\n>winning as the major drawing power.  \n\nFor the short term, IMO.  Although I think that it's inevitable that the team\nwill improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky, simply because they\nmake people around them better.\n\n>But winning sure as hell helps.  ;-)\n\nWell, at least we are in full agreement here!\n\n>This does not make Roger's point any more valid, but the Jets aren't\n\nSo are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? <couldn't resist...>\n\n>getting a HUGE jump in productivity, yet they ARE getting a huge\n>jump in attendance.  This is due to the emergence of Teemu Selanne.\n>They have the 17th best record in hockey, it sure as hell isn't because\n>they are winning.\n\nYes, but they are doing no worse than last year.  I think the same type of\nreasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people\nshowing up at Winnipeg games.  It's difficult to predict, but do you think\nthat if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they\nwill maintain their attendance levels?  I seriously doubt it, because in that\ncase the expectation of an improving team would be gone, with or without\nSelanne.\n\nI did provide the example of Rocket Ismail and the Toronto Argonauts of the \nCFL...did you leave it out because you don't know much about the CFL?  If \nthat's the case then fair enough, but if it isn't the case then I'm curious\nto hear your explanation.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" hockey"}

It appears that in\na neutral park Bo's HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two\nhome runs).  Or do they?  What is \"equivalent average?\"\n\nOne thing, when looking at Bo's stats, is that you can see that KC took\naway some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for\ndoubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you\nexpect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed, \nhit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his\nvalue to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.  \n\n> That is good. Very good, in fact.

I thought he\nwas always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so \nat baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn't\nwinning.\n\nNote 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a\nmistake being made (by the SDCN's, as they are known, on this group)\nwith respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).\n\nWe find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major\nand minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well.\nTheir are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction;\nthe lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent\nthe player has left college ball, etc.\n\nNow of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of \"error.\"  Sometimes\na player with poor MLE's (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star.\nSome hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don't (Oddibe\nMcDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are\nreal reasons why Oddibe didn't hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows)\ninvolve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting\nand so on.\n\nBut still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.\nOne of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background\nof the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is\nthat all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing\nball.  Their backgrounds are similar.\n\nWhat hasn't been established is what happens when you encounter a player\nwith a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a\nBo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so\non, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard\nassumptions fit this person slowly?\n\nIt hasn't been established that you can use MLE's with two-sport players.\n(It hasn't been established that you can't, but then statistics is, after\nall, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually\nmake completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton.\n\"Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,\" they say.  Well,\nwhat happens if those numbers simply don't mean what they usually mean?\nIt might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than\nTuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in\nAtlanta than Greenville.  \n\nThen again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank\nthis year, live up to those poor MLE's.  But you guys DON'T KNOW.  What's \nworse, you don't know that you don't.  And you don't know that there are \nother players you won't know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties \nagain.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.  It's not.\nIt's got some error.\n\nOh well.\n\nBill Guilford\n\nstill thinks \"hairy butt is truly ugly\" might be right\n\n###\n\n","completion":" baseball"}

{"prompt":"Subject: canadian silver dollar-stanley cup centennial\nFrom: hammerl@acsu.buffalo.edu (Valerie S. Hammerl)\nOrganization: UB\nNntp-Posting-Host: lictor.acsu.buffalo.edu\nLines: 19\n\n\nHi.  According to my always questionable newspaper, there's a silver\ndollar being minted in Canada, the back of which commemorates the\nanniversary of the Stanley Cup.  Now, I know full well what coins are\nused every day in Canada.  I can easily fish a few out of my pocket\nchange right now, in fact.  My question is, since the loon is the only\ndollar coin that I know is legal tender, is this just a commemorative\ncoin with no monetary exchange value, or what?  Is it the sort of\nthing that only hockey buffs and coin collectors might covet, with no\nchance of it being circulated?  If it is an uncirculated coin, what's\nthe current cost and what's its potential value?  Just curious.  If no\none knows, I'll take this to soc.culture.canada and rec.collecting (or\nwhatever it is).  Thanks again\n\n-- \nValerie Hammerl\t\t\t\"Some days I have to remind him he's not \nhammerl@acsu.buffalo.edu\tMario Lemieux.\"  Herb Brooks on Claude\nacscvjh@ubms.cc.buffalo.edu\tLemieux, top scorer for the Devils, but \nv085pwwpz@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu  known for taking dumb penalties.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" hockey"}

If they\nwere used as defensive centres it would be a waste of their offensive\nabilities. \n\nWhen you compare Gretzky et al to Jarvis, Gainey etc you are comparing \napples and oranges.  It is like me telling you that Felix Potvin isn't \nvery good because a team would be better if the had Lemieux instead of\nhim.  Sure Lemieux is a better player, but he is a different type of\nplayer.  For a team to be successful, they need to have all types of\nplayers- this includes defensive forwards.\n\nWhen compared with other defensive forwards, Bob Gainey is the greatest\ndefensive forward ever.  He is the player who's talents best suited being\na defensive forward- who completely dominated the game when he played.\n\nMaybe if a more talented player such as Gretzky had decided to waste his\noffensive talents and play defensively, he could have been a better\ndefensive forward, but he wasn't.\n\nBob Gainey is the best defensive forward that has ever played hockey.\n\nGregmeister\n\n###\n\n","completion":" hockey"}
