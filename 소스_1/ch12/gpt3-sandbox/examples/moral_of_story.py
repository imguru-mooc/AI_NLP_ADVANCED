    "A boy named John was upset. His father found him crying.When his father asked John why he was crying, he said that he had a lot of problems in his life.His father simply smiled and asked him to get a potato, an egg, and some coffee beans. He placed them in three bowls.He then asked John to feel their texture and then fill each bowl with water.John did as he had been told. His father then boiled all three bowls.Once the bowls had cooled down, John’s father asked him to feel the texture of the different food items again.John noticed that the potato had become soft and its skin was peeling off easily; the egg had become harder and tougher; the coffee beans had completely changed and filled the bowl of water with aroma and flavour.",

    "Once upon a time in a circus, five elephants that performed circus tricks. They were kept tied up with weak rope that they could’ve easily escaped, but did not.One day, a man visiting the circus asked the ringmaster: “Why haven’t these elephants broken the rope and run away?”The ringmaster replied: “From when they were young, the elephants were made to believe that they were not strong enough to break the ropes and escape.”It was because of this belief that they did not even try to break the ropes now.",

The hare simply wanted to prove that he was the best and have the satisfaction of beating him.The tortoise agreed and the race began.The hare got a head-start but became overconfident towards the end of the race. His ego made him believe that he could win the race even if he rested for a while.And so, he took a nap right near the finish line.Meanwhile, the tortoise walked slowly but extremely determined and dedicated. He did not give up for a second and kept persevering despite the odds not being in his favour.While the hare was asleep, the tortoise crossed the finish line and won the race!The best part was that the tortoise did not gloat or put the hare down!")
